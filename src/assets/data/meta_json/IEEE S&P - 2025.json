    "abstract": " Quantization Neural Networks (QNNs) has been widely adopted in resource-constrained edge devices due to their real-time capabilities and low resource requirement. However, concerns have arisen regarding that deployed models are white-box available to model thefts. To address this issue, TEE-shielded secure inference has been introduced as a secure and efficient solution. Nevertheless, existing methods neglect the compatibility with 8-bit quantized computation, which leads to severe integer overflow issue during inference. This issue could result a disastrous degradation in QNNs (to random guessing level), completely destroying model utility. Moreover, the model confidentiality and inference integrity also face a substantial threat due to the limited data representation space. To safeguard accurate and efficient inference for QNNs, TEE-Shielded QNN Partition (TSQP) are proposed, which presents three key insights: Firstly, Quantization Manager is designed to convert white-box inference to black-box by shielding critical scales in TEE. Additionally, overflow concerns are effectively addressed using reduced-range approaches. Secondly, by leveraging the Information Bottleneck theory to enhance model training, we introduce Parameter De-Similarity to defend against powerful Model Stealing attacks that existing methods are vulnerable to. Thirdly, the Integrity Monitor is suggested to detect inference integrity breaches in an oblivious manner. In contrast, existing method can be bypassed due to the lack of obliviousness. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed TSQP maintains high accuracy and achieves accurate integrity breaches detection. Our method achieves more than 8x speedup compared to full TEE inference, while reducing Model Stealing attacks accuracy from 3.99x to 1.29x. To our best knowledge, proposed method is the first TEE-shielded secure inference solution that achieves model confidentiality, inference integrity and model utility on QNNs. "

    "abstract": " While fuzzing has demonstrated its effectiveness in exposing vulnerabilities within embedded firmware, the discovery of crashing test cases is only the first step in improving the security of these critical systems. The subsequent fault localization process, which aims to precisely identify the root causes of observed crashes, is a crucial yet time-consuming post-fuzzing work. Unfortunately, the automated root cause analysis on embedded firmware crashes remains an underexplored area, which is challenging from several perspectives: (1) the fuzzing campaign towards the embedded firmware lacks adequate debugging mechanisms, making it hard to automatically extract essential runtime information for analysis; (2) the inherent raw binary nature of embedded firmware often leads to over-tainted and noisy suspicious instructions, which provides limited guidance for analysts in manually investigating the root cause and remediating the underlying vulnerability. To address these challenges, we design and implement FirmRCA, a practical fault localization framework tailored specifically for embedded firmware. FirmRCA introduces an event-based footprint collection approach that leverages concrete memory accesses in the crash reproducing process to aid and significantly expedite reverse execution. Next, to solve the complicated memory alias problem, FirmRCA proposes a history-driven method by tracking data propagation through the execution trace, enabling precise identification of deep crash origins. Finally, FirmRCA proposes a novel strategy to highlight key instructions related to the root cause, providing practical guidance in the final investigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of FirmRCA, we evaluate it with both synthetic and real-world targets, including 41 crashing test cases across 17 firmware images. The results show that FirmRCA can effectively (92.7% success rate) identify the root cause of crashing test cases within the top 10 instructions. Compared to state-of-the-art works, FirmRCA demonstrates its superiority in 27.8% improvement in full execution trace analysis capability, polynomial-level acceleration in overall efficiency and 73.2% higher success rate within the top 10 instructions in effectiveness.

    "abstract": " WebAssembly runtimes embed compilers to compile WebAssembly code into machine code for execution. These compilers use various compiler rules to define how to optimize and lower the WebAssembly code. However, existing testing tools struggle to explore these rules effectively due to their complexity. Moreover, they cannot generate test cases diversely due to their limitations, which can result in undetected bugs. This paper presents RGFuzz, a differential fuzzer for WebAssembly runtimes, addressing the existing limitations through two novel techniques. First, RGFuzz uses rule-guided fuzzing, which extracts compiler rules from the WebAssembly runtime, wasmtime, and uses them to guide test case generation, thereby effectively exploring complex rules. Second, RGFuzz uses reverse stack-based generation to generate test cases diversely. These techniques enable RGFuzz to find bugs effectively in WebAssembly runtimes. We implemented RGFuzz and evaluated it on six engines: wasmtime, Wasmer, WasmEdge, V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore. As a result, RGFuzz found 20 new bugs in these engines, including one bug with a CVE ID issued. Our evaluation demonstrates that RGFuzz outperforms existing fuzzers by utilizing the extracted rules and diversely generating test cases. "

    "abstract": " As one of the most fundamental Internet components, DNS has served various purposes and thus DNS traffic usually exhibits diverse patterns and is probably the least blocked by network administrators. These make DNS an attractive channel for attackers to establish surreptitious communications (i.e., DNS tunneling). In fact, such a surreptitious channel has been widely abused for command and control (C2) and enterprise-unapproved virtual private network (VPN). Existing approaches exclusively rely on the statistical characteristics of a sequence of DNS queries to detect DNS tunneling. Unfortunately, these approaches by nature cannot guarantee zero data leakage and can be evaded when the stolen data is exfiltrated over many root domains. As a result, state-of-the-art approaches are more suitable for threat investigation and forensic analysis, but not for DNS tunneling prevention. To fill this protection gap, we propose TunTight, the first system that is able to achieve in-path per-query DNS tunneling prevention. Our key insight is that DNS tunneling domains have unique characteristics in their authoritative nameservers, domain usage, and domain name patterns. Based on these characteristics, a set of unique features are defined and extracted which are fed to a machine learning model. To validate the efficacy of TunTight, we integrate it into the cloud backend of an enterprise firewall product by one of the largest security vendors. In our two-months real-world deployment, TunTight has successfully detected 349 confirmed tunnels at the very first query with negligible false positives and negatives. We also conduct the first large-scale study of DNS tunneling activities in the wild. One interesting finding is that most DNS tunneling traffic in enterprise networks come from public tunneling tools and enterprise-unapproved VPN services. "

    "abstract": " Reports regarding the misuse of Generative AI (GenAI) to create deepfakes are frequent. Defensive watermarking enables GenAI providers to hide fingerprints in their images and use them later for deepfake detection. Yet, its potential has not been fully explored. We present UnMarker--- the first practical universal attack on defensive watermarking. Unlike existing attacks, UnMarker requires no detector feedback, no unrealistic knowledge of the watermarking scheme or similar models, and no advanced denoising pipelines that may not be available. Instead, being the product of an in-depth analysis of the watermarking paradigm revealing that robust schemes must construct their watermarks in the spectral amplitudes, UnMarker employs two novel adversarial optimizations to disrupt the spectra of watermarked images, erasing the watermarks. Evaluations against SOTA schemes prove UnMarker's effectiveness. It not only defeats traditional schemes while retaining superior quality compared to existing attacks but also breaks semantic watermarks that alter an image's structure, reducing the best detection rate to 43% and rendering them useless. To our knowledge, UnMarker is the first practical attack on semantic watermarks, which have been deemed the future of defensive watermarking. Our findings show that defensive watermarking is not a viable defense against deepfakes, and we urge the community to explore alternatives. "

The ideal defense should be effective, efficient, easy to deploy, and capable of withstanding adaptive attacks. In this paper, we adopt a counterattack strategy to propose a novel and general methodology for defending adversarial attacks. Two types of defensive patches, canary and woodpecker, are specially-crafted and injected into the model input to proactively probe or counteract potential adversarial patches. In this manner, adversarial patch attacks can be effectively detected by simply analyzing the model output, without the need to alter the target model. Moreover, we employ randomized canary and woodpecker injection patterns to defend against defense-aware attacks. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments. The results illustrate that canary and woodpecker achieve high performance, even when confronted with unknown attack methods, while incurring limited time overhead. Furthermore, our method also exhibits sufficient robustness against defense-aware attacks, as evidenced by adaptive attack experiments. "

    "abstract": " Phishing warning researchers have proposed two forms of hyperlink restrictions for reducing phishing click- through rates: focused attention, which prevents users from proceeding to a suspicious URL until they click the uncovered link inside the warning; and time delay, which disables link clicking for a short period of time. Both measures aim to draw user attention to the warning and nudge them to carefully evaluate the respective link’s URL. However, the effectiveness of these measures has so far not been comparatively evaluated. We conducted a mixed-methods online experiment (n=1,320) to understand differences in the effectiveness of focused attention and time delay both independently and together. Our study used an instrumented email inbox environment, in which participants were asked to assess emails and email hyper- links. We found that, while both focused attention and time delay reduced click-through rates independently, the strength of these effects were significantly different from each other with focused attention being more effective than time delay. Combining both measures reduced CTR even further. We also found that participants who saw a warning with a time delay were more likely to hover over hyperlinks for longer than those who saw a focused attention warning. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of anti-phishing warnings. "

    "abstract": " Modern systems make extensive use of resource virtualization to achieve high hardware utilization and minimize the total cost of ownership. However, sharing of physical resources invariably opens the door to side-channel exploitation where co-located attackers can covertly examine a victim’s behavior and/or steal private information. Even though applications may not share data, they still compete for shared physical resources, notably for cache capacity. Since cache lookup is data/address-dependent, even the presence or absence of data in the cache can reveal sensitive information. This paper proposes Ceviche, a novel hardware virtualization strategy that allows for the secure allocation and use of physical cache resources among threads that belong to different trust domains. In particular, Ceviche enables a capability-based cache lookup by translating a given address-domain ID pair into a capability that encodes the access rights and the allowed set of operations on the physical cache line that it grants access to. By constraining cache lookup to occur based on a capability, Ceviche can achieve fine-grained partitioning of the cache at the granularity of a cache line, enforcing a wide set of confidentiality, availability, and fairness guarantees, while maximizing cache utilization. The paper presents detailed design mechanisms, policies, and optimizations along with extensive evaluation to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the secure virtualization layer into modern multicore cache hierarchies. Ceviche caches offer protections at all levels of the cache hierarchy and incur an average performance degradation of 2.4% when compared to an insecure baseline, while only imposing 1.8% additional performance degradation over state-of-the-art secure caches Mirage and ScatterCache.

Misconfigured cloud buckets can inadvertently expose these secrets, leading to unauthorized access to services and security breaches. In this work, we explore the issue of secret leaks in files exposed through misconfigured cloud storage. Our analysis covers a variety of file formats frequently used in development and focuses on different secrets that have diverse types of impact as well as the possibility for a non-intrusive validation. By systematically scanning a large collection of publicly accessible cloud buckets, we identified 215 instances where sensitive credentials were exposed. These secrets provide unauthorized access to services like databases, cloud infrastructure, and third-party APIs, posing significant security risks.Upon discovering these leaks, we responsibly reported them to the respective organizations and cloud service providers and measured the outcomes of the disclosure process. Our responsible disclosure efforts led to the remediation of 95 issues. Twenty organizations directly communicated their actions back to us, promptly addressing the issues, while the remaining fixes were implemented without direct feedback to the disclosers.

In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end vulnerability analysis approach, called MOCGuard, that can effectively vet Java web applications against MOC issues. Different from related techniques, MOCGuard pinpoints MOC vulnerabilities from a new perspective of database-centric analysis. MOCGuard first applies database structure analysis to infer user table and user-owned data. Then, MOCGuard conducts insecure access checks across both the Java and SQL layers. To thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of MOCGuard, we collaborated with a world-leading tech company. Through our evaluation of 30 high-profile open-source Java web applications and 7 industrial Java web applications, we demonstrate that MOCGuard is automatic and effective. Consequently, it successfully uncovered 161 (confirmed) 0-day MOC vulnerabilities, leading to the assignment of 73 CVE identifiers. "

    "abstract": " As the dominant container orchestration system, Kubernetes has a large ecosystem of third-party applications. The third-party Kubernetes applications access various cluster resources to extend the cluster functionality and Kubernetes adopts the RBAC mechanism to manage the resource access permissions. Recently, researchers revealed that third-party applications are granted excessive permissions and proposed an excessive permission attack. The attacker can exploit some critical excessive permissions to escape from the worker node and take over the whole Kubernetes cluster. However, this attack assumes that the attacker has compromised a worker node via container escape, which is difficult to realize in real scenarios. Therefore, we propose a new excessive permission attack with simpler attack conditions in this paper. We reveal that an attacker who has compromised one pod (less difficult than compromising a worker node) can exploit some other excessive privileges to take over worker nodes or break the availability and data confidentiality of other pods. Although excessive permissions of third-party applications pose a great threat to the security of Kubernetes clusters, there is no effective approach for detecting them. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, namely EPScan, which automatically detects exploitable excessive permissions in third-party applications. To achieve this, EPScan employs a novel pod-oriented program analysis, which utilizes several new techniques to accurately identify the resource access behavior of the programs running in each pod. EPScan then compares the permissions required for these behaviors with those requested by the pod in its configuration file and finally reports the exploitable permissions that can be abused to launch an excessive permissions attack. We applied EPScan on 108 third-party applications from the CNCF projects and discovered previously unknown exploitable excessive permissions in 106 pods across 50 applications with a precision of 94.6% and 9 CVE identifiers assigned.

Despite these risks, the security of model sharing, particularly for TensorFlow, remains under-investigated. To address these security concerns, we present a systematic analysis of the security risks associated with TensorFlow APIs. We introduce the TensorAbuse attack, which exploits hidden capabilities of TensorFlow APIs, such as file access and network messaging, to construct powerful and stealthy attacks. To facilitate this, we developed two novel techniques: one for identifying persistent APIs in TensorFlow and another for leveraging large language models to accurately analyze and classify API capabilities. We applied these techniques to TensorFlow v2.15.0 and identified 1,083 persistent APIs with five main capabilities. We exploited 20 of these APIs to develop five attack primitives and four synthetic attacks, including file leak, IP exposure, arbitrary code execution, and shell access. Our tests revealed that Hugging Face, TensorFlow Hub, and ModelScan could not detect any of these attacks. We have reported these findings to Google, Hugging Face, and ModelScan, and are currently working with them to address these issues. "

Existing approaches relying on memory encryption introduce substantial performance and power overheads, which are exacerbated by the need for real-time data processing and strict power efficiency requirements in mobile platforms. These issues hinder the wider adoption of Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), which aims to provide robust security guarantees. To address these challenges, we present PORTAL, a secure and efficient device I/O interface for Arm CCA on mobile Arm SoCs. PORTAL achieves secure I/O through strict memory isolation without the need for memory encryption.

This design eliminates the overhead associated with encryption, supports dynamic peripheral integration, and maintains robust security guarantees. The evaluation results demonstrate that PORTAL incurs a minimal one-time overhead of 9.8%, while enhancing scalability and power efficiency, making it a pivotal solution for fostering the adoption of the upcoming Arm CCA in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Prior works face challenges in finding prototype pollution gadgets for such consequences because the control- or data-flow change sometimes needs the injection of complex property values to replace existing undefined ones through prototype pollution, which may not have been seen before or cannot be solved by existing constraint solvers. In this paper, we design a dynamic analysis framework, called GALA, to automatically detect client-side prototype pollution gadgets among real-world websites, and implement an open-source version of GALA.

A key aspect of these strategies includes system-level optimizations for super apps and other widely used apps, marking a competitive trend among OEMs. Granting privileges to such apps often stems from trust in these apps. However, without proper validation of apps' identities, this can lead to severe implicit trust vulnerabilities, providing a convenient pathway for malicious apps to impersonate privileged ones and gain their access rights.

    "abstract": " The shuffle model of DP (Differential Privacy) provides high utility by introducing a shuffler that randomly shuffles noisy data sent from users. However, recent studies show that existing shuffle protocols suffer from the following two major drawbacks. First, they are vulnerable to local data poisoning attacks, which manipulate the statistics about input data by sending crafted data, especially when the privacy budget epsilon is small. Second, the actual value of epsilon is increased by collusion attacks by the data collector and users. In this paper, we address these two issues by thoroughly exploring the potential of the augmented shuffle model, which allows the shuffler to perform additional operations, such as random sampling and dummy data addition. Specifically, we propose a generalized framework for local-noise-free protocols in which users send (encrypted) input data to the shuffler without adding noise. We show that this generalized protocol provides DP and is robust to the above two attacks if a simpler mechanism that performs the same process on binary input data provides DP. Based on this framework, we propose three concrete protocols providing DP and robustness against the two attacks. Our first protocol generates the number of dummy values for each item from a binomial distribution and provides higher utility than several state-of-the-art existing shuffle protocols. Our second protocol significantly improves the utility of our first protocol by introducing a novel dummy-count distribution: asymmetric two-sided geometric distribution. Our third protocol is a special case of our second protocol and provides pure epsilon-DP. We show the effectiveness of our protocols through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. "

However, little is known about the prevalence and productivity of these teams, or how team members collaborate. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study. The first stage characterized teams from a top-down ecosystem perspective. We collected bug bounty rankings from 85 platforms, using fuzzy-matching to identify 2.1k unique teams and 5.9k hunters. We show that 46% of users are registered as part of a team, and hunters with teams are more than twice as productive as hunters without teams. The typical team has less than 10 members and only operates on a handful of platforms, but we also identified mega teams participating in more than 50 platforms with hundreds of team members. The second phase provided bottom-up insights into why hackers join teams and how they collaborate within teams. Our semi-structured interviews (n = 18) reveal bug hunting teams are multi-faceted - part study club, part labor union, and part start-up. Teams act like study clubs in enabling knowledge exchange and skills development, and act like labor unions in negotiating with bug bounty platforms and vendors. Hunter teams also displayed company-like aspects when earning and sharing revenue, and also creating rules that members should follow. In doing so, hunter teams help to address three of the main challenges that bug hunters face, namely skills development, negotiating with large technology companies, and income uncertainty. "

    "abstract": " Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based BFT protocols balance consensus efforts across different parties and maintain high throughput even when some designated parties fail. However, existing DAG-based BFT protocols exhibit long latency to commit decisions, primarily because they have a \\emph{leader} every 2 or more ``rounds''. Recent works, such as Shoal (FC'23) and Mysticeti, have deemed supporting a leader vertex in each round particularly difficult, if not impossible. Consequently, even under honest leaders, these protocols require high latency (or communication complexity) to commit the proposal submitted by the leader (leader vertex) and additional latency to commit other proposals (non-leader vertices). In this work, we present \\name, the first DAG-based BFT that supports a leader vertex in each round. Under honest leaders, \\name maintains a commit latency of one reliable broadcast (RBC) round plus $1\\delta$ to commit the leader vertex (where $\\delta$ is the actual transmission latency of a message) and only an additional RBC round to commit non-leader vertices. We also extend \\name to \\multiname, which facilitates multiple leaders within a single round and commits all leader vertices in a round with a latency of one RBC round plus $1\\delta$. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our protocols introduce significantly lower latency overhead compared to existing DAG-based protocols, with similar throughput. "

    "abstract": " Microarchitectural side-channel attacks are an insidious threat to program security. An emerging class of these attacks constructs gadgets that dereference the contents of data memory directly. This is caused by optimizations, such as speculative execution and data-memory prefetching, that can guess (incorrectly) that the program is performing a pointer chase. In theory, this is devastating for security, as dereferencing a secret seemingly leaks it over memory-based side channels, e.g., through the cache. In practice, it is not. Since most secrets do not look like valid pointers, their dereference typically fails and does not leak anything. In this paper, we introduce the page walk side channel (PWSC), a new attack that can leak information even when an invalid pointer is dereferenced. In particular, given a 64-bit secret that passes the address canonicality check, PWSC can leak all remaining bits of the secret except for the low-order 6 bits, without making any assumptions on what these bits look like. We demonstrate how PWSC amplifies leakage in scenarios exploiting speculative execution and data-memory prefetching. For speculative execution, we show that PWSC, combined with Intel's LAM feature, can be exploited to leak nearly all of physical memory and that even without LAM, PWSC can be used to leak Dilithium secret keys. For data-memory prefetching, we reverse engineer the semantics of Intel's data-memory dependent prefetcher (DMP) and show how this DMP and PWSC can be combined to break security in an intra-process sandbox setting.

We systematically evaluate the landscape of brokered SSO, uncovering significant blind spots in previous research. Our study reveals that 25% of the websites with SSO integrate brokers for authentication, an area that has not been covered by any previous research. Through our comprehensive security evaluation, we identify three categories of threats associated with brokered SSO: (1) insufficient validation of redirect chains enabling injection attacks, (2) unauthorized data access enabling account takeovers, and (3) violations of security best current practices. We expose vulnerabilities in over 50 brokers, compromising the security of more than 2k websites.

However, it inevitably causes infringement and misuse problems with the data, such as using unauthorized online artworks or face images to train ML models. To address this problem, many efforts have been made to audit the copyright of the model training dataset. However, existing solutions vary in auditing assumptions and capabilities, making it difficult to compare their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, robustness evaluations usually consider only part of the ML pipeline and hardly reflect the performance of algorithms in real-world ML applications. Thus, it is essential to take a practical deployment perspective on the current dataset copyright auditing tools, examining their effectiveness and limitations. Concretely, we categorize dataset copyright auditing research into two prominent strands: intrusive methods and non-intrusive methods, depending on whether they require modifications to the original dataset. Then, we break down the intrusive methods into different watermark injection options and examine the non-intrusive methods using various fingerprints. To summarize our results, we offer detailed reference tables, highlight key points, and pinpoint unresolved issues in the current literature.

Prior work has established that misuse of cryptographic libraries is common, and developers struggle to use their APIs correctly.

To investigate these decisions and associated challenges in the design and implementation process of cryptographic library APIs, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with experienced developers of cryptographic libraries and used thematic analysis to identify overarching topics and challenges they encountered. We find that design decisions span a spectrum of abstraction levels and are heavily influenced by cryptographic standards, other libraries, legacy code, and developers' intuitions. Developers are challenged by the optimal level of abstraction for cryptographic APIs to balance security, usability, and flexibility. They lack systematic knowledge on defining usability and achieving such balance. Consequently, developers rely on usability self-tests, personal experiences, and opinions. Based on our findings, we make detailed recommendations to tailor future research toward better empirically validated support of cryptographic library API design and implementation decisions.

Turning to risk uncertainty, we discovered that in the aggregate users are relatively well calibrated regarding the frequency of different incidents.

Therefore, prior security studies primarily focused on radio access networks with limited treatment of backhaul and core network interfaces. In this paper, we performed a security evaluation of real-world GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) deployments. GTP is the fundamental protocol for user traffic management between base stations and core networks (inside the Walled Garden) from 3G to 5G, thus often assumed inaccessible and non-exploitable from the Internet. However, our study reveals for the first time the troubling state of GTP access control in real-world deployments. Aided by a semi-automated tool, our measurements discovered around 749,000 valid GTP hosts accessible via the public Internet, spanning across 1,176 service providers in 162 countries. Our results demonstrate potential exposure of mobile core network infrastructures to external threats. We then evaluated the attack surface of exposed GTP infrastructures, and found out that as many as 38 types of GTP messages can be misused to launch various attacks such as denial-of-service and session hijacking. Our experiments using open source 4G and 5G projects in isolated lab environments further confirm the feasibility of those GTP-based attacks, including remote hijacking of user traffic sent through cellular core networks. In addition to threats against cellular networks and their subscribers, exposed GTP devices could also be weaponized to launch large-scale reflective denial-of-services (RDoS) attacks. We hope our findings will increase awareness of GTP vulnerabilities among operators and the security community, highlighting the urgent need to further strengthen security in cellular core networks.

This paper introduces RACEDB, a novel system that tackles these challenges through two key innovations. Application-aware Request Race Detection (ARD) provides a comprehensive analysis of data dependencies, considering not only the database schema but also the application code. This allows RACEDB to identify subtle race conditions that might be missed by existing approaches. Furthermore, RACEDB employs an automated verification technique using replay-based execution. This technique efficiently isolates true races from false positives and generates definitive exploits for verified vulnerabilities. We evaluated RACEDB on a dataset of 14 real-world PHP web applications. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of RACEDB compared to existing tools. RACEDB achieved a superior detection rate, identifying 21 known vulnerabilities and discovering 18 new vulnerabilities, significantly exceeding the performance of existing tools while also achieving a lower rate of false positives. Finally, we responsibly reported all newly discovered vulnerabilities to the corresponding developers, and 7 of them have been assigned CVE IDs. "

    "abstract": " Advanced wireless communication systems adopt deep learning (DL) approaches to achieve automatic modulation recognition (AMR) for spectrum monitoring and management, especially in the spectrum bands supporting diverse coexisting wireless protocols. In practical wireless environments, wireless signals can easily get compromised by malicious noise, intentional interference, and adversarial attacks, reducing the effectiveness of AMR. By exploiting DL model vulnerabilities, an undetectable perturbation added to the wireless signal can cause misclassification, resulting in serious consequences including decoding errors, throughput degradation, and communication disruption. Facing the limitations of existing works on defending against wireless adversarial attacks, this work innovates the Transformer model to design an adversarial robust AMR driven by exploring temporal correlation in time-sequence wireless signals. Instead of directly applying the Vision Transformer (ViT), we first innovate a feature extraction module specifically for radio frequency (RF) signals from both the time and frequency domains, together with an adaptive positional embedding to the Transformer encoder for enhancing AMR accuracy. To mitigate the noise effect in practical wireless communication, we then propose a noise-adaptive adversarial training scheme on the developed Transformer-based model using adversarial examples crafted by white-box attackers. To show the scheme's efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness, our proposed design has been thoroughly evaluated via a self-collected real-world dataset consisting of over 30 million wireless signal data samples with 21 modulation schemes in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our results reach a maximum accuracy of 94.17% in AMR classification and 71.2% under adversarial attacks. Besides, for the first time, we demonstrate the robustness of our design under a real wireless adversarial attack in real-time.

We observe that, when loops operate over ciphertexts, it becomes extremely challenging to effectively interpret the control structures within the loop and construct operator cost models for the main body of the loop. Consequently, most existing compiler frameworks have inadequate support for programs involving non-trivial loops, undermining the expressiveness of programming over FHE. To achieve both efficient and general of program execution over FHE, we propose CHLOE, a new compiler framework with multi-level control-flow analysis for the effective optimization of compound repetition control structures. We observe that loops over FHE can be classified into two categories depending on whether the loop condition is encrypted, namely, the transparent loops and the oblivious loops. For transparent loops, we can directly inspect the control structures and build operator cost models to apply FHE-specific loop segmentation and vectorization in a fine-grained manner. Meanwhile, for oblivious loops, we derive closed-form expressions and static analysis techniques to reduce the number of potential loop paths and conditional branches. In the experiment, we show that CHLOE can compile programs with complex loop structures into efficient executable codes over FHE, where the performance improvement ranges from 1.5x to 54x (up to 10e5x for programs containing oblivious loops) when compared to programs produced by the-state-of-the-art FHE compilers.

Reverse-engineering each of the new formats is costly as it requires extensive expertise and analysts' time. In this paper, we investigate the first step to automate the analysis of non-standard binaries, which is to recognize the bytes representing \"code\" from \"data\" (i.e., data-code separation). We propose Loadstar, and its key idea is to use the abundant labeled data from standard binaries to train a classifier and adapt it for processing unlabeled non-standard binaries. We use a pseudo-label-based method for domain adaption and leverage knowledge-inspired rules for pseudo-label correction, which serves as the guardrail for the adaption process. A key advantage of the system is that it does not require labeling any non-standard binaries. Using three datasets of non-standard PLC binaries, we evaluate Loadstar and show it outperforms existing tools in terms of both accuracy and processing speed.

    "abstract": " ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) is a new hardware feature introduced in ARMv8.5-A architecture, aiming to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. The low overhead of MTE makes it an attractive solution to mitigate memory corruption attacks in modern software systems and is considered the most promising path forward for improving C/C++ software security. This paper explores the potential security risks posed by speculative execution attacks against MTE. Specifically, this paper identifies new TikTag gadgets capable of leaking the MTE tags from arbitrary memory addresses through speculative execution. With TikTag gadgets, attackers can bypass the probabilistic defense of MTE, increasing the attack success rate by close to 100%. We demonstrate that TikTag gadgets can be used to bypass MTE-based mitigations in real-world systems, Google Chrome and the Linux kernel. Experimental results show that TikTag gadgets can successfully leak an MTE tag with a success rate higher than 95% in less than 4 seconds. We further propose new defense mechanisms to mitigate the security risks posed by TikTag gadgets. "

    "abstract": " The understanding of password security highly relates to our knowledge of how adversaries guess passwords, and this makes the modeling of guessing attacks a pivotal task. To maximize guessing effectiveness, the adversary generally attempts to guess in descending order of likelihood, akin to the way generative retrieval learning-to-rank works in a recommendation system, which prioritizes information to targeted users based on predicted relevance. In this paper, we propose a password guessing framework based on adversarial ranking, named RankGuess. We regard the password creation process as sequential decision trajectories. In this context, the adversary is assumed to train an agent where the current state is represented by the password sequence generated up to that point. The action taken is to generate the next token, and the evaluation score assigned by the ranker serves as the reward signal received. Consequently, we frame the problem of password guessing as a Markov Decision Process and tackle it using adversarial ranking techniques. Due to the generality of our framework, RankGuess can be applicable to various guessing scenarios (i.e., trawling guessing, targeted password guessing based on personally identifiable information (PII), and conditional password guessing). By employing 12 large-scale password datasets and six PII datasets, we demonstrate that our models are effective: (1) RankGuess surpasses all current state-of-the-art models and outperforms GAN-based methods by 26.29\\%$\\sim$43.69\\% (avg. 34.80\\%); (2) When the victim’s PII at site $A$ (namely PII$_A$) is known, RankGuess-PII for targeted password guessing based on PII$_A$, which guesses 58.21\\%$\\sim$91.95\\% of common users within $10^{12}$ guesses, outperforms its foremost counterparts by 6.32\\%$\\sim$17.09\\%; (3) Within $10^7$ guesses, our RankGuess-Mask based on victims’ partial passwords (e.g., d****l*02*), improves the password cracking success rates by 7.70\\%$\\sim$14.85\\% (avg. 8.21\\%) compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts.

Our protocols match the security guarantees and low costs of the cheapest category of MPC solutions, namely 3-party protocols (3PC) secure against a single malicious party, with the qualitative advantages that one party communicates data sublinear in the circuit size, and can go offline after its initial messages. This \"2+1\"-party structure can alternatively be instantiated between 2 parties with the aid of an (untrusted) dealer. Within such existing protocols, we provide comparable online performance while improving the storage and offline dealer-to-party communication requirements by more than 3 orders of magnitude. At the technical level, we build on the Fully Linear Interactive Oracle Proof (FLIOP)-based protocol design of Boyle et al. (CRYPTO 2021). We provide an extensive assortment of algorithmic and implementation-level optimizations, design efficient distributed proofs of well-formedness of complex FLIOP correlations, and make them circuit-independent. We implement and benchmark our end-to-end system against the state of the art in the 2+1 regime, a dealer-aided variant of SPDZ for Boolean circuits. We additionally extend our techniques to the (n+1) party setting, where a dealer aids general dishonest-majority MPC, and provide a variant of the protocol which further achieves security with \"identifiable abort\".

Logical vulnerabilities represent the most formidable threat to these programs, in the absence of memory safety related vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow. Go, a prevalent memorysafe language for cloud-based applications where resource availability is paramount, is especially susceptible to nonterminating, resource-exhaustive vulnerabilities. We present a novel approach to the problem, inductive constraint reasoning, designed to evaluate nontermination in complex, real-world programs, demonstrating superior performance compared to contemporary tools on a standardized dataset. Our methodology employs binary-level underconstrained symbolic execution to gather the constraints necessary for multiple recursive iterations. By applying a first-order derivative to these constraints, we model and classify various recursive functions, determining whether their subgoals converge to a global objective. This study addresses numerous challenges in the analysis of Go programs while simultaneously developing and implementing a practical solution to detect uncontrolled recursion, which has revealed 5 new vulnerabilities in the Go standard library.

To mitigate security and privacy risks from local network access, Apple introduced a new permission with iOS 14. To be effective, the permission needs to protect against technical threats, and users must be able to make an informed permission decision. The latter is presumably hindered by the intrinsic technicality of the concept of the local network. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive analysis of the local network permission by studying four key aspects. We investigate the security of its implementation by systematically accessing the local network. We explore local network accesses via a large-scale dynamic analysis of 10,862 iOS and Android apps. We analyze the concepts that constitute the permission prompts, as this is all the information users get before making a decision. Based on the identified concepts, we conduct an online survey (N=150) to comprehend users' understanding of the permission, their threat awareness, and common misconceptions. Our work reveals two methods to bypass the permission from webviews, and that the protected local network addresses are insufficient. We show how and when apps access the local network, and how the situation differs between iOS and Android. Finally, we present the light and shadow of users' understanding of the permission.

Our VSS protocols are optimally fault-tolerant, i.e., they tolerate a 1/2 and a 1/3 fraction of malicious nodes in synchronous and asynchronous networks, respectively. They only require a public key infrastructure and the hardness of discrete logarithms. Our protocols support dual thresholds, and their transcripts are publicly verifiable. We implement our VSS protocols and evaluate them in a geo-distributed setting with up to 256 nodes. The evaluation demonstrates that our protocols offer asynchronous termination and public verifiability with performance that is comparable to that of existing schemes that lack these features.

    "abstract": " Embedded devices are increasingly ubiquitous and vital, often supporting safety-critical functions. However, due to strict cost and energy constraints, they are typically implemented with Micro-Controller Units (MCUs) that lack advanced architectural security features. Within this space, recent efforts have created low-cost architectures capable of generating Proofs of Execution (PoX) of software on potentially compromised MCUs. This capability can ensure the integrity of sensor data from the outset, by binding sensed results to an unforgeable cryptographic proof of execution on edge sensor MCUs. However, the security of existing PoX requires the proven execution to occur atomically (i.e., uninterrupted). This requirement precludes the application of PoX to (1) time- shared systems, and (2) applications with real-time constraints, creating a direct conflict between execution integrity and the real-time availability needs of several embedded system uses. In this paper, we formulate a new security goal called Real-Time Proof of Execution (RT-PoX) that retains the integrity guarantees of classic PoX while enabling its application to existing real-time systems. This is achieved by relaxing the atomicity requirement of PoX while forbidding interference attempts from other potentially malicious tasks (or compromised operating systems) executing on the same device. To realize the RT-PoX goal, we develop Provable Execution Architecture for Real-Time Systems (PEARTS). To the best of our knowledge, PEARTS is the first PoX system that can be directly deployed alongside a commodity embedded real-time operating system (FreeRTOS). This enables both real-time scheduling and execution integrity guarantees on commodity MCUs. To showcase this capability, we develop a PEARTS open-source prototype atop FreeRTOS on a single-core ARM Cortex-M33 processor. Based on this prototype, we evaluate and report on PEARTS’s security and (modest) overheads "

Moreover, we experimentally carry out our attacks using a combination of Rowhammer, performance degradation, and memory massaging techniques, showing that our attacks are practically feasible.

    "abstract": " Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most essential biomarkers for various diseases. It is considered protected health information under HIPAA and usually needs the user's consent for access. In this work, we uncover an insidious privacy breach in metaverse usage: private BP information can be covertly obtained from unrestricted motion sensors in virtual reality (VR) headsets. The insight is that the motion sensors can capture the subtle vibrations induced by the blood waves in the major arteries. Such vibrations are highly correlated with users' cardiac cycles and BP. As adversaries can continuously obtain motion sensor data from VR headsets without users' consent, they can derive and collect users' BP information in metaverse apps or websites, leading to more severe consequences, such as discrimination, exploitation, and targeted harassment. To demonstrate this severe privacy leakage in the metaverse, we develop a practical attack, BPSniff, which can reconstruct fine-grained blood flow patterns and derive BP based on motion sensor data from users' VR headsets. BPSniff is the first practical attack revealing the BP leakage in the metaverse without using dedicated equipment. Unlike previous mobile sensing approaches that require user-specific calibration, BPSniff bypasses this constraint, enabling truly stealthy passive BP attacks at scale. Our attack first employs a variational autoencoder to reconstruct high-fidelity blood flow patterns from VR headset motion sensor data. We then develop an Adam-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) regression model that leverages BP-related fiducial features from successive blood flow patterns to continuously estimate the user's BP. We evaluate BPSniff through extensive experiments and a longitudinal study of 8 weeks involving 37 participants and two VR headset models. The results show that BPSniff can achieve low mean errors of 1.75 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 1.34 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), which are comparable to commercial BP monitors and satisfy the standard (i.e., mean error "

Master-password-protected password management (M3PM) protocols characterize the interaction between the client and the PM's server. In this protocol, the client uses the master password for authentication, and the server assists in retrieving credentials across devices. Given the ongoing PM data breaches and users' concerns about potential server misuse, it is crucial for the server to remain oblivious to both the master password and the credentials. The pivotal role of M3PM protocols underscores the need for a systematic and formal security analysis. In this paper, we, for the first time, present an extensive formal analysis of M3PM protocols. We identify the de facto M3PM protocols from 43 PMs in industry and academia by defining a methodology that includes documentation analysis, traffic analysis, and reverse engineering. To formalize the security properties of M3PM protocols, we propose a set of ideal functionalities within the universal composability (UC) framework. We categorize offline guessing attacks on master passwords into four types based on the knowledge of the adversary. Our analysis shows that 38 of the 43 PMs are vulnerable to at least one type of offline guessing attack, demonstrating the circumstances under which various M3PM protocols with single master password protection fail to resist such attacks. Additionally, we identify an oracle attack where a corrupted server can learn the encryption key of the well-known open-source Passbolt, and demonstrate that 1Password's dual-key mechanism provides strong protection for users' master passwords and credentials.

This paper proposes P2C2T -- a privacy-preserving cross-chain transfer scheme. It is the first scheme to address atomicity, unlinkability, indistinguishability, non-collateralization, and required functionalities across diverse currency systems. P2C2T is based on \\textit{threshold anonymous atomic locks} (TA$^2$L), also proposed by us, serving as the cornerstone for guaranteeing atomic cross-chain transfer while obscuring the payment relationships between users. By combining TA$^2$L with \\textit{verifiable timed discrete logarithm} schemes, P2C2T renders cross-chain transactions indistinguishable from regular intra-chain ones. Notably, P2C2T eliminates the collateralization of senders and imposes minimal requirements on underlying blockchains, specifically on the ability to verify signatures. We substantiate the security of TA$^2$L based on a proposed cryptographic notion called \\textit{threshold blind conditional signatures} and demonstrate the security of P2C2T through necessary proofs. Additionally, we compare the performance of P2C2T with an existing scheme that has properties closest to P2C2T. The comparison reveals that P2C2T reduces overhead by at least $85.488\\%$ in terms of running time, communication cost, and storage cost when completing a cross-chain transfer. We further conduct cross-chain transfers and intra-chain payments using the Bitcoin testnet and Litecoin testnet to illustrate the privacy and practicality of P2C2T. "

In this paper, we present a systems-level solution, viz., a reboot-based framework, Groundhog, that adds a layer of resiliency on top of threshold cryptosystems (as well as others); our framework ensures the system can be protected against malicious (mobile) adversaries that can corrupt up all but one device in the network. Groundhog ensures that a sufficient number of honest devices is always available to ensure the availability of the entire system.

We demonstrate the practicability of ZKLP by building a protocol for privacy preserving peer-to-peer proximity testing — Alice can test if she is close to Bob by receiving a single message, without either party revealing any other information about their location. In such a setting, Bob can create a proof of (non-)proximity in 0.26 s, whereas Alice can verify her distance to about 470 peers per second. "

    "abstract": " Lattice cryptography schemes based on the learning with errors (LWE) hardness assumption have been standardized by NIST for use as post-quantum cryptosystems, and by HomomorphicEncryption.org for encrypted compute on sensitive data. Thus, understanding their concrete security is critical. Most work on LWE security focuses on theoretical estimates of attack performance, which is important but may overlook attack nuances arising in real-world implementations. The sole existing concrete benchmarking effort, the Darmstadt Lattice Challenge, does not include benchmarks relevant to the standardized LWE parameter choices -- such as small secret and small error distributions, and Ring-LWE (RLWE) and Module-LWE (MLWE) variants. To improve our understanding of concrete LWE security, we provide the first benchmarks for LWE secret recovery on standardized parameters, for small and low-weight (sparse) secrets. We evaluate four LWE attacks in these settings to serve as a baseline: the Search-LWE attacks uSVP, SALSA, and Cool & Cruel, and the Decision-LWE attack Dual Hybrid Meet-in-the-Middle(MitM). We extend the SALSA and Cool & Cruel attacks in significant ways, and implement and scale up MitM attacks for the first time. For example, we recover hamming weight 9−11 binomial secrets for KYBER (κ=2) parameters in 28−36 hours with SALSA and Cool & Cruel, while we find that MitM can solve Decision-LWE instances for hamming weights up to 4 in under an hour for Kyber parameters, while uSVP attacks do not recover any secrets after running for more than 1100 hours. We also compare concrete performance against theoretical estimates. Finally, we open source the code to enable future research. "

    "abstract": " Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, they encounter the potential vulnerability from the link stealing attacks, which can infer the presence of a link between two nodes via measuring the similarity of its incident nodes' prediction vectors produced by a GNN model. Such attacks pose severe security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models. In this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID), to defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model utility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add carefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising adjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the graph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering all links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the further advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation cost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two adjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes and 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks under transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two influence-based attacks. Meanwhile, it achieves a much better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods when extended to GNNs. "

    "abstract": " While previous research backdoored neural networks by changing their parameters, recent work uncovered a more insidious threat: backdoors embedded within the definition of the network’s architecture. This involves injecting common architectural components, such as activation functions and pooling layers, to subtly introduce a model backdoor that persists even after (full re-)training, an impossible task for other backdoor types. Bober-Irizar et al. [2023] introduced the first architectural backdoor design, specifically showing how to create a backdoor for a checkerboard pattern. Yet, the full scope and implications of architectural backdoors have remained largely unexplored, in part because of the limitations in the original design. Namely, it could not be used to target custom triggers, required human involvement for detector construction, and provided no performance guarantees. In this work we revisit architectural backdoors and demonstrate realistic threats that they pose. First, we improve on the original design and construct an arbitrary trigger detector which can be used to backdoor any architecture with no human supervision. Second, we taxonomise 12 distinct architectural backdoor types, and provide an evaluation of their performance. Next, to gauge the difficulty of detecting such backdoors, we conduct a human study, revealing that ML developers can only identify suspicious components in common model definitions as backdoors in 37% of cases, while they surprisingly preferred backdoored models in 33% of cases. To contextualise these results, we find that language models outperform humans at the detection of backdoors. Finally, we discuss defenses against architectural backdoors, emphasising the need for robust and comprehensive strategies to safeguard the integrity of ML systems. "

    "abstract": " Web application vulnerabilities continue to pose a significant challenge. Static analysis is currently the mainstream approach to this issue, while dynamic analysis is not as widely used in comparison. However, both techniques have their limitations. While current static analysis tools are plagued by high false-positive rates, necessitating fine-grained analysis and substantial expertise, it is also the case that dynamic analysis tools are underdeveloped. Current fuzzing-based tools are often limited by inefficiency in exploring deeper code locations. Moreover, state-of-the-art grey-box fuzzers often struggle to capture effective parameters from user interfaces, thereby failing to explore the input space efficiently. In this paper, we propose Predator, a directed fuzzing framework equipped with selective dynamic instrumentation for effective and efficient web application vulnerability detection and validation. We use static analysis techniques and dynamic analysis techniques to complement each other. Our lightweight static analysis provides relevant URLs and parameters of the directed fuzzing targets and thus facilitates dynamic validation of static analysis reports. Additionally, we propose a runtime distance supplementation mechanism and tailored mutation strategies to address the dynamic features of interpreted languages like PHP. The evaluation shows Predator effectively triggers more vulnerabilities and outperforms state-of-the-art grey-box fuzzers by up to 43.8 times in terms of time to exposure. Moreover, Predator detects 26 previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications, further demonstrating its effectiveness. At the time of writing, 7 of the 26 vulnerabilities have been confirmed and patched by the corresponding vendors. "

Existing detection mechanisms are either too late to catch such malicious domains due to limited information and their short life spans or unable to catch them due to evasive techniques such as cloaking and captcha. In this work, we investigate the possibility of detecting malicious domains early in their life cycle using a content-agnostic approach. We observe that attackers often reuse or rotate hosting infrastructures to host multiple malicious domains due to increased utilization of automation and economies of scale. Thus, it gives defenders the opportunity to monitor such infrastructure to identify newly hosted malicious domains. However, such infrastructures are often shared hosting environments where benign domains are also hosted, which could result in a prohibitive number of false positives. Therefore, one needs innovative mechanisms to better distinguish malicious domains from benign ones even when they share hosting infrastructures. In this work, we build MANTIS, a highly accurate practical system that not only generates daily blocklists of malicious domains but also is able to predict malicious domains on-demand. We design a network graph based on the hosting infrastructure that is accurate and generalizable over time. Consistently, our models achieve a precision of 99.7%, a recall of 86.9% with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.1% and on average detects 19K new malicious domains per day, which is over 5 times the new malicious domains flagged daily in VirusTotal. Further, MANTIS predicts malicious domains days to weeks before they appear in popular blocklists. "

    "abstract": " Network side-channel attacks have recently been highlighted due to their severity and elusive nature. For example, SADDNS attacks allow an off-path attacker to launch cache poisoning attacks leveraging network side channels. Due to the subtle nature of network side channels, it is challenging to identify such side channels. To this date, few automated bug discovery techniques are tailored for such vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, none of them is general and automated enough, making their impact and longer-term use limited. In this paper, we describe the first solution that aims to fill this gap. Specifically, we develop SCAD, aiming at identifying violations of the non-interference property, which are commonly understood as the root cause of network side channels. As non-interference property is a hyperproperty, it necessitates reasoning across multiple execution traces. This motivated us to develop our solution based on under-constrained and dynamic symbolic execution. The state-of-the-art solution, SCENT, applies model checking, which requires extra effort in modeling or simplifying certain parts of a network protocol, in order to scale. Unfortunately, such modeling and simplification is time-consuming, error prone, and can overlook important details, leading to missed vulnerabilities. For example, it was reported that 2.5 person-week was required to construct a self-contained using SCENT. In comparison, SCAD requires only a single person-day to perform labeling of secrets and attacker-observables, and decide the analysis scope. By applying SCAD to multiple TCP and UDP implementations, including Linux, FreeBSD, and lwIP, we find 14 network side-channels, 7 of which were previously unknown, with a false positive rate of only 17.6%. The results reveal serious vulnerabilities, including those that can be used to compromise the previously patched Linux and FreeBSD kernels, making them susceptible to SADDNS attacks or off-path TCP exploits. Our analysis concludes that the majority of the side channels cannot be found by existing solutions due to the aforementioned limitations. "

Despite significant efforts to combat these obfuscators over the past decade, code virtualization continues to be an exceedingly effective obfuscation technique. At the core of modern virtualization obfuscators are the virtual machines (VMs), which employ a variety of diversification techniques to complicate their internal structures. Due to its intricate and diverse nature, reverse engineering one VM is a time-consuming task and is not useful in cracking other VMs. Yet, despite the success of these VMs, there has been no systematic study of their diversification techniques, creating a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed to enhance VM deobfuscation.

    "abstract": " Query-based black-box attacks have emerged as a significant threat to machine learning systems, where adversaries can manipulate the input queries to generate adversarial examples that can cause misclassification of the system. To counter these attacks, researchers have proposed Stateful Defense Models (SDMs) such as BlackLight and PIHA, which can reject queries that are \"similar\" to historical queries. However, recent studies show that existing approaches are vulnerable to a stronger adaptive attack, Oracle-guided Adaptive Rejection Sampling (OARS). OARS can be easily integrated with existing attack algorithms to evade the SDMs by generating queries with fine-tuned direction and step size of perturbations utilizing the leaked decision boundary from the SDMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Query Provenance Analysis (QPA), for defending against query-based black-box attacks robustly (against both non-adaptive and adaptive attacks) and efficiently (in real-time). Our key insight is that, instead of focusing on individual queries, utilizing features from the query sequence (termed query provenance) can distinguish malicious queries from benign queries more effectively. We construct a query provenance graph to capture the relationship between a new query and prior historical queries, and then design efficient algorithms to detect malicious queries based on the query provenance graphs. We evaluate QPA on four datasets against six query-based attacks and compare QPA with state-of-the-art SDM defenses. The results show that QPA outperforms the baselines regarding defense robustness and efficiency on both non-adaptive and adaptive attacks. Specifically, QPA reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of OARS to 4.08%, which is roughly 20x lower than the baselines. Moreover, QPA achieves higher throughput (up to 7.67x) and lower latency (up to 11.09x) than baselines. "

Such a lightweight solution, enabling AI practitioners and developers to easily build their own personalized models, also poses a new concern regarding whether the personalized models are trained from unauthorized data. A promising solution is to proactively enable data traceability in generative models, where data owners embed external coatings (e.g., image watermarks or backdoor triggers) onto the datasets before releasing. Later the models trained over such datasets will also learn the coatings and unconsciously reproduce them in the generated mimicries, which can be extracted and used as the data usage evidence. However, we identify the existing coatings cannot be effectively learned in personalization tasks, making the corresponding verification less reliable.

Usually, such warnings are visual in nature and fail to cater to users with visual disabilities. To address this exclusion, we developed an aural variant of telephone scam warnings and tested them in three conditions: baseline (no warning), short warning, and contextual warning that preceded the scam’s content. We tested the two most common scam scenarios: fraud (interest rate reduction) and identity theft (social security number) by cold-calling participants and recording their actions, and debriefing and obtaining consent afterward. Only two participants “pressed one” as the scam demanded, both from the legally blind group that heard the contextual warning for the social security scenario. Upon close inspection, we learned that one of them did so because of accessibility issues with their screen reader and the other did so intentionally because the warning convinced them to waste the scammer’s time, so they don’t scam vulnerable people.

This paper investigates why, and how this status quo can be improved. Noting that existing approaches are fraught with inconsistencies in terminology and analytical methods, we propose a unified model for the systematic analysis, comparison, and directing of compartmentalization approaches. We use this model to review 211 research efforts and analyze 61 mainstream compartmentalized systems, confronting them to understand the limitations of both research and production works. Among others, our findings reveal that mainstream efforts largely rely on manual methods, custom abstractions, and legacy mechanisms, poles apart from recent research. We conclude with recommendations: compartmentalization should be solved holistically; progress is needed towards simplifying the definition of compartmentalization policies; towards better challenging our threat models in the light of confused deputies and hardware limitations; as well as towards bridging the gaps we pinpoint between research and mainstream needs. This paper not only maps the historical and current landscape of compartmentalization, but also sets forth a framework to foster their evolution and adoption. "

    "abstract": " This paper empirically evaluates the efficacy of two ubiquitous forms of enterprise security training: annual cybersecurity awareness training and embedded anti-phishing training exercises. Specifically, our work analyzes the results of an 8-month randomized controlled experiment involving ten simulated phishing campaigns sent to over 19,500 employees at a large healthcare organization. Our results suggest that these efforts offer limited value. First, we find no significant relationship between whether users have recently completed cybersecurity awareness training and their likelihood of failing a phishing simulation. Second, when evaluating recipients of embedded phishing training, we find that the absolute difference in failure rates between trained and untrained users is extremely low across a variety of training content. Third, we observe that most users spend minimal time interacting with embedded phishing training material in-the-wild; and that for specific types of training content, users who receive and complete more instances of the training can have an increased likelihood of failing subsequent phishing simulations. Taken together, our results suggest that anti-phishing training programs, in their current and commonly deployed forms, are unlikely to offer significant practical value in reducing phishing risks.

    "abstract": " Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This \"encryption-in-use\" feature is crucial for securely outsourcing computations in privacy-sensitive areas such as healthcare and finance. Nevertheless, in the context of FHE-based cloud computing, clients often worry about the integrity and accuracy of the outcomes. This concern arises from the potential for a malicious server or server-side vulnerabilities that could result in tampering with the data, computations, and results. Ensuring integrity and verifiability with low overhead remains an open problem, as prior attempts have not yet achieved this goal. To tackle this challenge and ensure the verification of FHE's private computations on encrypted data, we introduce DataSeal, which combines the low overhead of the algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) technique with the confidentiality of FHE, offering high efficiency and verification capability. Through thorough testing in diverse contexts, we demonstrate that DataSeal achieves much lower overheads for providing computation verifiability for FHE than other techniques that include MAC, ZKP, and TEE. DataSeal's space and computation overheads decrease to nearly negligible as the problem size increases. "

Nevertheless, this paper shows that the confidentiality of NNs and user data is compromised by the recently disclosed ciphertext side channels in TEEs, which leak memory write patterns of TEE-shielded NNs to malicious hosts. While recent works have used ciphertext side channels to recover cryptographic key bits, the technique does not apply to NN inputs which are more complex and only have partial information leaked. We propose an automated input recovery framework, CipherSteal, and for the first time demonstrate the severe threat of ciphertext side channels to NN inputs. CipherSteal novelly recasts the input recovery as a two-step approach — information transformation and reconstruction — and proposes optimizations to fully utilize partial input information leaked in ciphertext side channels. We evaluate CipherSteal on diverse NNs (e.g., Transformer) and image/video inputs, and successfully recover visually identical inputs under different levels of attacker’s pre-knowledge towards the target NNs and their inputs. We comprehensively evaluate two popular NN frameworks, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and NN executables generated by two recent NN compilers, TVM and Glow, and study their different attack surfaces. Moreover, we further steal the target NN’s functionality by training a surrogate NN with our recovered inputs, and also leverage the surrogate NN to generate \"white-box\" adversarial examples, effectively manipulating the target NN’s predictions.

    "abstract": " Digital signatures underpin identity, authenticity, and trust in modern computer systems. Cryptography research has shown that it is possible to prove possession of a valid message and signature for some public key, without revealing the message or signature. These proofs of possession work only for specially-designed signature schemes. Though these proofs of possession have many useful applications to improving security, privacy, and anonymity, they are not currently usable for widely deployed, legacy signature schemes like RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519. Unlocking practical proofs of possession for these legacy signature schemes requires closing a huge efficiency gap. This work brings proofs of possession for legacy signature schemes very close to practicality. Our design strategy is to encode the signature's verification algorithm as a rank-one constraint system (R1CS), then use a zkSNARK to prove knowledge of a solution. To do this efficiently we (1) design and analyze a new zkSNARK called Dorian that supports randomized computations, (2) introduce several new techniques for encoding hashes, elliptic curve operations, and modular arithmetic, (3) give a new approach that allows performing the most expensive parts of ECDSA and Ed25519 verifications outside R1CS, and (4) generate a novel elliptic curve that allows expressing Ed25519 curve operations very efficiently. Our techniques reduce R1CS sizes by up to 200× and prover times by more than 20×. We can generate a 240-byte proof of possession of an RSA signature over a message the size of a typical TLS certificate—two kilobytese—in only three seconds. "

    "abstract": " Many enterprises struggle to apply security patches in time to remove the risk of security breaches. Delays can be attributed to technical dependencies, outdated asset inventories, and issues of scale. Governments have started pursuing a strategy of mandating through regulation the patching of a highly selective set of severe vulnerabilities under very strict deadlines. We worked with a large organization to examine the patching timelines under these regulatory deadlines. We analyze patching ticket-system entries for 81 security advisories over seven years, covering 944 CVEs. We complement this with nine interviews with professionals involved in managing patches. We find that 40.2% of advisories required patching action, with a median completion time of 13.2 days; advisories that do not end in requiring a patch have a median of 1.4 days. Completing the patching process in 48 hours – a recommended industry best practice – is achieved in just 16.2% of the cases. For the deadline of one week, under the Dutch BIO regulation, patching is achieved in 32.4% of the cases, while the performance against the typical CISA KEV deadlines is a bit more hopeful: 56.8% is patched in two weeks and 62.2% in three weeks. We find that some variance in delays can be explained by coordination effort, as measured by the number of involved teams and people. Overall, the strategy of regulatory deadlines for a highly selective set of priority vulnerabilities is associated with much faster enterprise patching. The deadlines are routinely missed, yet they need to trade off realism versus exposure. The three-week KEV deadline is more feasible than the 48-hour one, yet it also leaves open a longer exposure window for exploitation. "

Typically, quantum circuits and programs that execute on quantum computers, are defined using gate-level primitives.

The attacks presented in this work leverage the inconsistency between the gate-level description of the custom gate, and the actual, low-level pulse implementation of this gate. By manipulating the custom gate specification, this work proposes numerous attacks: qubit plunder, qubit block, qubit reorder, timing mismatch, frequency mismatch, phase mismatch, and waveform mismatch. This work demonstrates these attacks on the real quantum computer and simulator, and shows that most current software development kits are vulnerable to these new types of attacks. In the end, this work proposes a defense framework.

    "abstract": " A zero-bit watermarked language model produces text that is indistinguishable from that of the underlying model, but which can be detected as machine-generated using a secret key. Unfortunately, merely detecting AI-generated spam, say, may not prevent future abuses. If we could additionally trace the text to a spammer's API token or account, we could then cut off their access or pursue legal action. Moreover, prior works lack provable guarantees when prompts to the watermarked model are chosen by an adaptive adversary. We introduce multi-user watermarks, which allow tracing model-generated text to individual users or to groups of colluding users, even in the face of adaptive prompting. We construct multi-user watermarking schemes from undetectable, adaptive, zero-bit watermarking schemes (and prove that the undetectable zero-bit scheme of Christ, Gunn, and Zamir is robust against adaptive prompting). Importantly, our schemes provide both zero-bit and multi-user assurances at the same time: detecting shorter snippets just as well as the original scheme, and tracing longer excerpts to individuals. Along the way, we give a generic construction of a watermarking scheme that embeds long messages into generated text. Ours are the first black-box reductions between watermarking schemes for language models. A major challenge is the lack of a unified abstraction for robustness — that marked text is detectable even after edits. Existing works give incomparable robustness guarantees, based on bespoke requirements on the language model's outputs and the users' edits. We introduce a new unifying abstraction called AEB-robustness. AEB-robustness provides that the watermark is detectable whenever the edited text \"approximates enough blocks\" of model-generated output. Specifying the robustness condition amounts to defining approximates, enough, and blocks. Using our new abstraction, we relate the robustness properties of our message-embedding and multi-user schemes to that of the underlying zero-bit scheme, in a black-box way. "

This development has opened up a vast realm of possibilities, pushing the boundaries of human creativity into unexplored frontiers. However, as generative AI continues to advance, it can replicate artistic styles and produce new artwork, posing significant concerns for the perceived rarity and value of artists’ creations. In response to these challenges, it is becoming increasingly crucial to establish and enforce protective measures that safeguard artists’ copyrighted work from unauthorized exploitation by generative AI models. In this paper, we introduce the first defensive mechanism, HARMONYCLOAK, to prevent the exploitative use of artwork, specifically in the context of music, by generative AI models. Particularly, HARMONYCLOAK employs imperceptible error-minimizing noise to make the model’s generative loss approach zero for these perturbed music data, tricking the model into believing nothing can be learned so as to disrupt their attempts to replicate musical structures and styles. By using a set of intra-track and inter-track objective metrics and a subjective user study, extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art music generative AI models (i.e., MuseGAN, SymphonyNet, and MusicLM) validate the effectiveness and applicability of HARMONYCLOAK in both white-box and black-box settings.

In this study, we explore user perspectives of WhatsApp mods through an interview study (n=20) of mod users in Kenya, one of the countries with the highest WhatsApp mod usage. Many turned to WhatsApp mods for their \"advanced\" features to protect themselves (e.g., \"anti-delete\" for legal liability), while others admitted to using mod features to hide their behavior or to stalk others. To understand how users’ expectations of WhatsApp mods align with the apps' behavior, we identify and analyze 13 instances of the most common mod (GB WhatsApp). While WhatsApp mods contained the features they claimed to offer, some participants incorrectly believed that features currently available in the official app only existed in mods. Additionally, several mods were significantly over-permissioned compared to the official WhatsApp, despite participants believing that they requested the same permissions as the official app. While almost half of participants indicated they trust mods more than the official WhatsApp, we found two mods contained malware. The use of WhatsApp mods poses risks to mod users and those they communicate with, but also empowers users in ways that the official app does not.

This performance is partly achieved by sacrificing memory safety, which introduces the risk of memory bugs—the root cause of many of today’s most severe vulnerabilities. Numerous solutions have been proposed to detect and prevent memory bugs, with the most effective employing dynamic program analysis to sanitize memory accesses. These memory safety sanitizers vary greatly in their capabilities, covering different memory regions and detecting different subsets of memory bugs. While conceptual classifications of these sanitizers exist, practical and quantitative evaluations have primarily focused on performance rather than their actual bug-finding capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MSET, a tool for evaluating memory safety sanitizers, along with an extensive functional evaluation of the most powerful and widely used memory safety sanitizers. We systematically deconstruct memory safety bugs into distinct properties, such as the memory region, the method of memory corruption, and the type of access to the target buffer. Using this systematization, our tool generates test cases that combine small and unique code templates, covering all typical memory bugs, including various forms of buffer overflows, underflows, and use-after-frees. Our functional evaluation highlights the differences between the conceptual detection potential of sanitization techniques and the bug-finding capabilities of sanitizers with similar objectives. Furthermore, it reveals that multiple sanitizers fail to achieve their conceptual potential due to incomplete or faulty implementations. Our tool is available as open source software, enabling researchers and practitioners to test their sanitizers and uncover lost potential, conceptual shortcomings, and implementation errors. "

In this study, we pivot from examining individual search requests to analyzing search sessions, defined as sequences of consecutive search queries made by the same user. We found that benign users exhibit coherent behavior patterns within these sessions, which contrast clearly with those of fraudulent actors. Specifically, legitimate users tend to conduct searches focused on a single topic at a time. In contrast, fraudsters or automated bots often exhibit diverse, illogical, and incoherent search behaviors within a session. To address this behavioral distinction, we propose COSEC, a system designed to quantify the “incoherence index” of search sessions. COSEC integrates literal semantic, temporal, and ad-click behavioral features to evaluate sessions’ coherence quantitatively. Our evaluation of COSEC demonstrates high efficacy, achieving a precision of 95.79% and a recall of 92.40% in identifying incoherent sessions, highlighting COSEC’s substantial potential to enhance real-world click fraud detection.

Since preferences are subjective, there is no gold standard to compare against; yet, reliance of high-impact systems on preference learning creates a strong motivation for malicious actors to skew data collected in this fashion to their ends. We investigate the nature and extent of this vulnerability by considering an attacker who can flip a small subset of preference comparisons to either promote or demote a target outcome.

Next, we evaluate the efficacy of best attacks in both these classes in successfully achieving malicious goals on datasets from three domains: autonomous control, recommendation system, and textual prompt-response preference learning. We find that the best attacks are often highly successful, achieving in the most extreme case 100% success rate with only 0.3% of the data poisoned. However, which attack is best can vary significantly across domains. In addition, we observe that the simpler and more scalable rank-by-distance approaches are often competitive with, and on occasion significantly outperform, gradient-based methods. Finally, we show that state-of-the-art defenses against other classes of poisoning attacks exhibit limited efficacy in our setting. "

    "abstract": " The right to be forgotten mandates that machine learning models enable the erasure of a data owner’s data and information from a trained model. Removing data from the dataset alone is inadequate, as machine learning models can memorize information from the training data, increasing the potential privacy risk to users. To address this, multiple machine unlearning techniques have been developed and deployed. Among them, approximate unlearning is a popular solution, but recent studies report that its unlearning effectiveness is not fully guaranteed. Another approach, exact unlearning, tackles this issue by discarding the data and retraining the model from scratch, but at the cost of considerable computational and memory resources. However, not all devices have the capability to perform such retraining. In numerous machine learning applications, such as edge devices, Internet-of-Things (IoT), mobile devices, and satellites, resources are constrained, posing challenges for deploying existing exact unlearning methods. In this study, we propose a Constraint-aware Adaptive Exact Unlearning System at the network Edge (CAUSE), an approach to enabling exact unlearning on resource-constrained devices. Aiming to minimize the retrain overhead by storing sub-models on the resource-constrained device, CAUSE innovatively applies a Fibonacci-based replacement strategy and updates the number of shards adaptively in the user-based data partition process. To further improve the effectiveness of memory usage, CAUSE leverages the advantage of model pruning to save memory via compression with minimal accuracy sacrifice. The experimental results demonstrate that CAUSE significantly outperforms other representative systems in realizing exact unlearning on the resource-constrained device by 9.23%-80.86%, 66.21%-83.46%, and 5.26%-194.13% in terms of unlearning speed, energy consumption, and accuracy.

In response, industry and government have deployed new technologies and regulations to curb the problem, and academic and industry researchers have provided methods and measurements to characterize robocalls.

In this paper, we address these questions through analysis of data from several independently-operated vantage points, ranging from industry and academic voice honeypots to public enforcement and consumer complaints, some with over 5 years of historic data. We first describe how we address the non-trivial methodological challenges of comparing disparate data sources, including comparing audio and transcripts from about 3 million voice calls. We also detail the substantial coherency of these diverse perspectives, which dramatically strengthens the evidence for the conclusions we draw about robocall characterization and mitigation while highlighting advantages of each approach. Among our many findings, we find that unsolicited calls are in slow decline, though complaints and call volumes remain high. We also find that robocallers have managed to adapt to STIR/SHAKEN, a mandatory call authentication scheme. In total, our findings highlight the most promising directions for future efforts to characterize and stop telephone spam. "

    "abstract": " Verifying image provenance has become an important topic, especially in the realm of news media. To address this issue, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) developed a standard to verify image provenance that relies on digital signatures produced by cameras. However, photos are usually edited before being published, and a signature on an original photo cannot be verified given only the published edited image. In this work, we describe VerITAS, a system that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to prove that only certain edits have been applied to a signed photo. While past work has created image editing proofs for photos, VerITAS is the first to do so for realistically large images (30 megapixels). Our key innovation enabling this leap is the design of a new proof system that enables proving knowledge of a valid signature on a large amount of witness data. We run experiments on realistically large images that are more than an order of magnitude larger than those tested in prior work. In the case of a computationally weak signer, such as a camera, we are able to generate a proof of valid edits for a 90 MB image in just over thirteen minutes, costing about $0.54 on AWS per image. In the case of a more powerful signer, we are able to generate a proof of valid edits for a 90 MB image in just over three minutes, costing only $0.13 on AWS per image. Either way, proof verification time is less than a second. Our techniques apply broadly whenever there is a need to prove that an efficient transformation was applied correctly to a large amount of signed private data. "

    "abstract": " Since Spectre's initial disclosure in 2018, the difficulty of mitigating speculative execution attacks completely in hardware has led to the proliferation of several new variants and attack surfaces in the past six years. Most of the progeny build on top of the original Spectre attack's key insight, namely that CPUs can execute the wrong control flow transiently and disclose secrets through side-channel traces when attempting to alleviate control hazards, such as conditional or indirect branches and return statements. In this paper we go beyond (speculatively) affecting control flow, and present a new data speculation primitive that stems from microarchitectural optimizations designed to alleviate data hazards. More specifically, we show that Apple CPUs are equipped with a Load Address Predictor (LAP). The LAP monitors past addresses from the same load instruction to speculatively load a predicted address, which may incorrectly point to secrets at rest (i.e., never architecturally read by the CPU). Once the secret is retrieved, the LAP allows for a large speculation window that suffices for an adversary to compute on the secret, such as leaking it over a covert channel. We demonstrate the LAP's presence on recent Apple CPUs, such as the M2, A15, and newer models. We then evaluate the LAP's implications on security by showing its capabilities to read out-of-bounds, speculatively invoke rogue functions, break ASLR, and compromise the Safari web browser. Here, we leverage the LAP to disclose sensitive cross-site data (such as inbox content from Gmail) to a remote web-based adversary. "

We present Growlithe, a tool that integrates with the serverless application development toolchain and enables continuous compliance with data policies by design. Growlithe allows declarative specification of access and data flow control policies over a language- and platform-independent dataflow graph abstraction of a serverless application, and enforces these policies through a combination of static analysis and runtime enforcement. We used Growlithe with applications using Python and JavaScript functions that can be hosted on AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions platforms.

    "abstract": " Recent literature has shown that LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious attackers inject a secret token sequence (i.e., trigger) into training prompts and enforce their responses to include a specific target sequence. Unlike discriminative NLP models, which have a finite output space (e.g., those in sentiment analysis), LLMs are generative models, and their output space grows exponentially with the length of response, thereby posing significant challenges to existing backdoor detection techniques, such as trigger inversion. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the LLM backdoor learning process under specific assumptions, revealing that the autoregressive training paradigm in causal language models inherently induces strong causal relationships among tokens in backdoor targets. We hence develop a novel LLM backdoor scanning technique, BAIT (Large Language Model Backdoor ScAnning by Inverting Attack Target). Instead of inverting back- door triggers like in existing scanning techniques for non-LLMs, BAIT determines if a model is backdoored by inverting back- door targets, leveraging the exceptionally strong causal relations among target tokens. BAIT substantially reduces the search space and effectively identifies backdoors without requiring any prior knowledge about triggers or targets. The search-based nature also enables BAIT to scan LLMs with only the black-box access. Evaluations on 153 LLMs with 8 architectures across 6 distinct attack types demonstrate that our method outperforms 5 baselines. Its superior performance allows us to rank at the top of the leaderboard in the LLM round of the TrojAI competition (a multi-year, multi-round backdoor scanning competition). "

    "abstract": " The growing adoption of cloud computing raises pressing concerns about trust and data privacy. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been proposed as promising solutions that implement strong access control and transparent memory encryption within the CPU. While initial TEEs, like Intel SGX, were constrained to small isolated memory regions, the trend is now to protect full virtual machines, e.g., with AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, and Arm CCA. In this paper, we challenge the trust assumptions underlying scaled-up memory encryption and show that an attacker with brief physical access to the embedded SPD chip can cause aliasing in the physical address space, circumventing CPU access control mechanisms. We devise a practical, low-cost setup to create aliases in DDR4 and DDR5 memory modules, breaking the newly introduced integrity guarantees of AMD SEV-SNP. This includes the ability to manipulate memory mappings and corrupt or replay ciphertext, culminating in a devastating end-to-end attack that compromises SEV-SNP's attestation feature. Furthermore, we investigate the issue for other TEEs, demonstrating fine-grained, noiseless write-pattern leakage for classic Intel SGX, while finding that Scalable SGX and TDX employ dedicated alias detection, preventing our attacks at present. In conclusion, our findings dismantle security guarantees in the SEV-SNP ecosystem, necessitating AMD firmware patches, and nuance DRAM trust assumptions for scalable TEE designs. "

Typically, attention is only paid to the realism of attack behaviors, which comprises only a small percentage of the audit logs in the dataset, while other characteristics of the data are inscrutable and unknown. We propose a new set of questions for what to talk about when we talk about logs (i.e., datasets): What activities are in the dataset? We introduce a novel visualization that succinctly represents the totality of 100+ GB datasets by plotting the occurrence of provenance graph neighborhoods in a time series. How synthetic is the background activity? We perform autocorrelation analysis of provenance neighborhoods in the training split to identify process behaviors that occur at predictable intervals in the test split. Finally, how conspicuous is the malicious activity? We quantify the proportion of attack behaviors that are observed as benign neighborhoods in the training split as compared to previously-unseen attack neighborhoods. We then validate these questions by profiling the classification performance of state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems (R-CAID, FLASH, KAIROS, GNN) against a battery of public benchmark datasets (DARPA Transparent Computing and OpTC, ATLAS, ATLASv2). For all classifiers, we demonstrate that synthetic background activities dramatically inflate True Negative Rates, while conspicuous malicious activities artificially boost True Positive Rates. Further, by explicitly controlling for these factors, we provide a more holistic picture of classifier performance.

    "abstract": " Provenance analysis is one of the go-to solutions today for human analysts to investigate security incidents. To assist analysts in managing the sheer size of provenance graphs, many pruning solutions have been proposed. Such solutions rely on graph-theory features, anomaly detection, and other techniques to identify nodes and edges that are irrelevant to the detected incident. Despite differences in their methodologies, those solutions typically share a common approach when it comes to the detected incident, i.e., they merely regard the incident as an abstract starting point, without tapping into it further. However, we observe that this may lead to missed opportunities for pruning, since the incident is typically associated with external information, e.g., knowledge about the exploit or the vulnerability, which may provide extra contextual insights for effective pruning. Based on such an observation, we propose CONTEXTS, a solution that complements existing pruning approaches by leveraging external information about the incident. Specifically, the solution extracts contextual information from external sources, maps such information to provenance graph nodes, and then correlates those nodes to form a subgraph relevant to the incident. Our implementation and experiments based on real-world attacks demonstrate its effectiveness, e.g., working as the pre-processor of an existing pruning approach, it helps to reduce the false positives from more than 150k to less than ten, and as a standalone pruning solution, CONTEXTS achieves 100% TPR for 19 out of 20 attacks, with an FPR below 0.6% for 16 out of 20 attacks.

Threshold signing can be divided into offline and online phases, based on whether the message is required. Schemes with low-cost online phases are referred to as \"online-friendly\". Another critical aspect of threshold ECDSA for real-world applications is robustness, which guarantees the successful completion of each signing execution whenever a threshold number t of semi-honest participants is met, even in the presence of misbehaving signatories. The state-of-the-art online-friendly threshold ECDSA without robustness was developed by Doerner et al. in S&P'24, requiring only three rounds. Recent work by Wong et al. in NDSS'23 (WMY+23) and NDSS'24 (WMC24) achieves robustness but demands additional communication rounds (7 and 4, respectively) or incurs costly operations in the online phase, such as computations over a homomorphic encryption scheme. This paper presents the first three-round threshold ECDSA scheme with both robustness and an online-friendly design. The online phase of our scheme relies solely on several elliptic-curve group operations, which are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than those based on linearly homomorphic encryption schemes. We implement our protocol and conduct a comprehensive comparison with WMY+23 and WMC24. Benchmark results show that the online phase of our scheme is 2.5 times faster than that of WMY+23 and hundreds of times faster than that of WMC24.

At the core of our constructions are efficient novel methods for evaluating Gold within two-party computation (2PC-Gold), achieving different security requirements. Here, the server P_s holds the PRF key k whereas the client P_c holds the PRF input x, and they jointly evaluate Gold in 2PC. 2PC-Gold uses standard Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) correlations and is information-theoretic and constant-round in the (V)OLE-hybrid model. We show: · For a semi-honest P_s and a malicious P_c: a 2PC-Gold that just uses a single (V)OLE correlation, and has a communication complexity of 3 field elements (2 field elements if we only require a uniformly sampled key) and a computational complexity of O(λ) field operations. We refer to this as half-malicious security. · For malicious P_s and P_c: a 2PC-Gold that just uses λ/4+O(1) VOLE correlations, and has a communication complexity of λ/4+O(1) field elements and a computational complexity of O(λ) field operations. These constructions support additional features and extensions, e.g., batched evaluations with better amortized costs where P_c repeatedly evaluates the PRF under the same key.

However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks. JailFuzzer is open-source and available at this repository: https://github.com/YingkaiD/JailFuzzer. "

    "abstract": " Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased demand for high-quality prompts, now considered valuable commodities in prompt marketplaces. However, this demand has also led to the emergence of prompt stealing attacks, where the adversary attempts to infer prompts from generated outputs, threatening the intellectual property and business models of these marketplaces. Previous research primarily examines prompt stealing on academic datasets. The key question remains unanswered: Do these attacks genuinely threaten in-the-wild prompts curated by real-world users? In this paper, we provide the first systematic study on the efficacy of prompt stealing attacks against in-the-wild prompts. Our analysis shows that in-the-wild prompts differ significantly from academic ones in length, semantics, and topics. Our evaluation subsequently reveals that current prompt stealing attacks perform poorly in this context. To improve attack efficacy, we employ a Text Gradient based method to iteratively refine prompts to better reproduce outputs. This leads to enhanced attack performance, as evidenced by improvements in METEOR score improvements from 0.207 to 0.253 for prompt recovery and from 0.323 to 0.440 for output recovery. Despite these improvements, we showcase that the fundamental challenges persist, highlighting the necessity for further research to improve and evaluate the effectiveness of prompt stealing attacks in practical scenarios.

Through an experimental analysis, we characterize the loss-like values returned by the Gemini fine-tuning API and demonstrate that they provide a useful signal for discrete optimization of adversarial prompts using a greedy search algorithm.

It also outperforms large language models like GPT-4 and o1 in accuracy and cost-effectiveness. Besides, we conduct a large-scale measurement study, analyzing 80,330,098 files from GitHub, PyPI, and WeChat. We found that up to 30% of projects are at risk of secret leaks.

This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of Git LFS, identifying 11 critical security properties that LFS servers must uphold.

These attacks exploit weaknesses in practical LFS server implementations and can lead to serious consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive files, malware injection, denial of service affecting all public repositories, and resource abuse.

    "abstract": " With the rapid adoption of LLM-based code assistants to enhance programming experiences, concerns over extraction attacks targeting private training data have intensified. These attacks specifically aim to extract Personal Information (PI) embedded within the training data of code generation models (CodeLLMs). Existing methods, using either manual or semi-automated techniques, have successfully extracted sensitive data from these CodeLLMs. However, the limited amount of data currently retrieved by extraction attacks risks significantly underestimating the true extent of training data leakage. In this paper, we propose an automatic PI data extraction attack framework against LLM-based code assistants, named CODEBREAKER. This framework is built on two core components: (i) the introduction of semantic entropy, which evaluates the likelihood of a prompt triggering the model to respond with training data; and (ii) an automatic dynamic mutation mechanism that seamlessly integrates with CODEBREAKER, reinforcing the iterative process across the framework and promoting greater interconnection between different PI elements within a single response. This boosts reasoning diversity, model memorization, and finally attack performance. Using four series of open-source CodeLLMs (i.e., CodeParrot, StarCoder2, Code Llama, CodeGemma) and two commercial code assistants (i.e., CodeFuse and GPT), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework: (i) CODEBREAKER outperforms all current state-of-the-art extraction attacks by 6.22% ~ 44.9% (averaging 21.79%); (ii) when PI within a single response originates from the same GitHub repository, our framework – considering multiple interconnections in the response – exceeds others by 3.88% ~ 32.37% (averaging 15.31%).

This paper explores the potential to circumvent LLM-based vulnerability auditors by diverting their focus, decided by the LLM attention mechanism, away from real vulnerable code segments. In these LLM-based vulnerability auditors, the attention mechanism is supposed to focus on potentially vulnerable code sections to identify security issues. Our approach introduces high-attention code snippets (code fragments designed to draw focus) into the codebase under review. By strategically diverting the model's focus away from actual vulnerabilities, this technique effectively ``blinds'' the LLM, resulting in missed detections. To scale this approach, we present Crazy-Ivan, an automated system that identifies and seamlessly integrates high-attention code snippets, shifting focus away from genuine vulnerabilities to decoy functions. Through systematic function-level prioritization and refinement, Crazy-Ivan optimizes the blinding effect, producing the Flashboom that can reduce the model’s capacity to detect true security risks. Our evaluation underscores the effectiveness of Flashboom, achieving blinding success rates of up to 96.3% on CodeLlama and 83.05% on Gemma, with notable cross-model transferability and applicability across multiple programming languages. In a case study with GitHub Copilot, Flashboom led the tool to overlook a critical blockchain vulnerability, underscoring the security implications of such attention-diverting attacks and the risks inherent in relying solely on LLM-based automated auditing systems.

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive security analysis of this quantum-resistant version of SSH in the literature: related works either focus on the hybrid key exchange in isolation and do not consider security of the overall protocol, or analyze the protocol in security models which are not appropriate for SSH, especially in the \"post-quantum\" setting. In this paper, we remedy the state of affairs by providing a thorough post-quantum cryptographic analysis of SSH. We follow a \"top-down\" approach wherein we first prove security of SSH in a more appropriate model, namely, our post-quantum extension of the so-called authenticated and confidential channel establishment (ACCE) protocol security model; our extension which captures \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks could be of independent interest. Then we establish the cryptographic properties of SSH's underlying primitives, as concretely instantiated in practice, based on our protocol-level ACCE security analysis: for example, we prove relevant cryptographic properties of \"Streamlined NTRU Prime\", a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) which is used in recent versions of OpenSSH and TinySSH, in the quantum random oracle model, and address open problems related to its analysis in the literature. Notably, our ACCE security analysis of post-quantum SSH relies on the weaker notion of IND-CPA security of the ephemeral KEMs used in the hybrid key exchange. This is in contrast to prior works which rely on the stronger assumption of IND-CCA secure ephemeral KEMs. Hence we conclude the paper with a discussion on potentially replacing IND-CCA secure KEMs in current post-quantum implementations of SSH with simpler and faster IND-CPA secure counterparts, and also provide the corresponding benchmarks.

As of November 2024, the WebPKI contains over 900 million valid certificates and over 8 million revoked certificates. We describe an instantiation of CRLite that encodes the revocation status of these certificates in a 6.7 MB package. This is 54% smaller than the original instantiation of CRLite presented at the 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, and it is 21% smaller than the lower bound claimed in that work. A sequence of clubcards can encode a dynamic dataset like the WebPKI revocation set. Using data from late 2024 again, we find that clubcards encoding 6 hour delta updates to the WebPKI can be compressed to 26.8 kB on average---a size that makes CRLite truly practical. We have extended Mozilla's CRLite infrastructure so that it can generate clubcards, and we have added client-side support for this system to Firefox. We report on some performance aspects of our implementation, which is currently the default revocation checking mechanism in Firefox Nightly, and we propose strategies for further reducing the bandwidth requirements of CRLite.

    "abstract": " Certificate revocation is essential for maintaining the security of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), ensuring that compromised or untrustworthy certificates are invalidated promptly. Traditional revocation mechanisms like Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) face significant challenges, including scalability issues, high bandwidth consumption, privacy concerns, and reliance on centralized infrastructure that can become points of failure. In this paper, we introduce AccuRevoke, a novel revocation scheme that leverages cryptographic accumulators and edge computing to address these challenges effectively. AccuRevoke enables clients to verify the revocation status of certificates efficiently without the need to contact Certificate Authorities (CAs) directly for each validation. By utilizing distributed accumulators and threshold cryptography, AccuRevoke ensures authenticity and integrity of revocation information, even when responses are generated by third-party Edge Compute Providers (ECPs). Our scheme significantly reduces bandwidth consumption by providing compact revocation proofs—approximately 21 bytes for membership proofs and 61 bytes for non-membership proofs—which are substantially smaller than traditional OCSP responses. To further optimize performance, especially in generating non-membership witnesses, we employ GPU acceleration, achieving considerable improvements in processing times. We compare AccuRevoke with existing revocation mechanisms, demonstrating advantages in bandwidth efficiency, reliability, auditability, and potential enhancements in privacy. Our evaluation shows that AccuRevoke offers a scalable and practical solution for revocation checking, improving the security and performance of TLS/PKI deployments.

Verbal passwords hold significant potential for scenarios where keyboard input is impractical (e.g., smart speakers, wearables, vehicles) or users have motor impairments that make typing difficult. Through two large-scale user studies, we assessed the viability of verbal passwords. In our first study (N = 2,085), freely chosen verbal passwords were found to have a limited guessing space, with 39.76% cracked within 10^9 guesses. However, in our second study (n = 600), applying word count and blocklist policies for verbal password creation significantly enhanced verbal password performance, achieving better memorability and security than traditional text passwords. Specifically, 65.6% of verbal password users (under the password creation policy using minimum word counts and a blocklist) successfully recalled their passwords in long-term tests, compared to 54.11% for text passwords. Additionally, verbal passwords with enforced policies exhibited a lower crack rate (6.5%) than text passwords (10.3%). These findings highlight verbal passwords as a practical and secure alternative for contexts where text passwords are infeasible, offering strong memorability with robust resistance to guessing attacks.

However, establishing a sound model for identifying sensitive memory objects in need of protection is hard, leading to emergent attack vectors that can be abused by attackers. In this paper, we propose rethinking how OS kernels are hardened by introducing IUBIK for compartmentalizing kernel memory. IUBIK prevents kernel exploitation by segregating attacker-controlled data—frequently used to manipulate security-critical data—in shadow memory, preventing it from interacting with sensitive kernel objects. To achieve this, IUBIK uses MTE: a recent hardware feature, available in ARM CPUs, which allows mitigating exploits based on both spatial and temporal memory-errors, efficiently. We ensure that segregated objects do not contain sensitive fields, such as pointers, by rewriting their struct definitions. Moreover, we develop a profiling framework that explores the kernel codebase in-depth and records code sites where attacker-controlled objects are allocated, allowing IUBIK to isolate them; our profiler recorded 292 privileged and 212 non-privileged allocation sites for a diverse set of workloads. Finally, we evaluate an implementation of IUBIK for the Linux kernel, across a suite of micro- and macro-benchmarks, demonstrating that our prototype incurs no runtime overhead in most tests and negligible additional memory consumption.

In this work, we empirically study known gadget chains, and discover that adversaries usually construct gadget chains by diverging the execution to paths that developers never considered. The methods that get unexpectedly jump into (i.e., executed) are referred to as possible methods (PM). Based on the observation, we propose PFORTIFIER, a framework for automatic POI patch generation.

We evaluate PFORTIFIER on 31 PHP applications and frameworks.

The methodology establishes an ``anatomy'' of space infrastructures via the innovative notions of mission control flows and mission data flows, which are respectively inspired by the notions of control flows and data flows in program analysis. We show how the space infrastructure vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses studied in the literature can be mapped to space mission control flows and mission data flows, leading to insights such as: {\\em improper memory allocation} and {\\em lack of authentication} are the two most exploited vulnerabilities reported; Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) security is most studied, mainly via physical layer security; and the most effective approach to attack the space segment is to pivot through the ground segment.

    "abstract": " Over the past decade, the proliferation of Low Earth Orbit satellites, driven by lower launch costs, has revolutionized space applications, from communication to earth observation and weather forecasting. This trend also introduced a shift in hardware: Specialized radiation-resistant hardware was displaced by cheaper commercial off-the-shelf components. As a critical part of modern infrastructure, satellites attract cyber attacks and are subject to terrestrial and space-specific threats, necessitating effective security measures. However, cryptographic protections and exploit mitigations remain limited in productive satellite firmware. Academic research on satellite security only focuses on cryptographic protections, which raises the question if exploit mitigation strategies are suitable for satellites or impacted by space-specific factors, such as cosmic radiation. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of 381 small satellite designs, identifying the prevalence of commercial off-the-shelf hardware platforms in space projects and the availability of ready-to-use exploit mitigation strategies for satellite platforms. Since mitigations are seemingly available, we explore the effects of cosmic radiation on software-based exploit mitigations by implementing RadSim, an automated tool for simulating single event errors (bitflips). Our study simulated over 21 billion faults in differently hardened satellite firmware binaries to assess the fault tolerance of exploit mitigation strategies in the presence of cosmic radiation. Our results reveal that some mitigations barely impact the fault tolerance, while others increase the error probability of hardened satellite firmware by up to 19%. These findings provide novel insights into the trade-offs between exploit mitigation effectiveness and radiation resilience, offering guidance to satellite developers on optimizing security in space-based system "

    "abstract": " Leveraging direct-to-cell (DTC) satellites in low-earth orbits (LEO) to directly provide communication services for terrestrial cellphones is gaining popularity in recent years. However, the unique characteristics of the wireless medium in space-ground communication, combined with the dynamic behavior of LEO satellites, raise a new privacy leakage risk that an adversary eavesdropping on DTC broadcasts could steal the physical locations of active users. In this paper, we investigate new techniques to analyze the location leakage risks in emerging LEO direct-to-cell satellite networks (DCSN). We present DCator, a novel location leakage analyzer which continuously monitors DTC signaling messages in broadcast channels, extracts various location clues and combines them with the time-varying satellite trajectories to infer the physical locations of active users. We use DCator to analyze the consequences if an adversary is able to continuously monitor and process broadcast DTC signaling to deduce the locations of other users within the same satellite coverage area, in three representative DCSNs: (i) the operational Iridium; (ii) the developing Starlink DTC; and (iii) a DCSN based on the latest 3GPP NTN standards. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the existence of location leakages in real DCSNs, and in the worst case an adversary can precisely track the locations of other users within hundreds of meters. Finally, we propose privacy-enhancing countermeasures for DCSNs. "

To explore if and how developers implement privacy requirements, participants were divided into 3 groups: control, privacy prompted, and privacy expert-supported.

However, privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are often technologically complex and opaque to lay users. It is challenging to understand and effectively communicate the functionality of complex PETs to the users, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Studies typically assess the impact of new PETs by presenting users with a high-level description of the technology before measuring how this treatment changed their attitude or behavior. These results influence business and regulatory decisions (see Gartner's Hype Cycle for Emerging Technology. In the present study, we question this approach. We assess whether naming specific PETs and providing generic descriptions impact users' willingness to put trust in service providers and share their data. Our survey presented three randomized controlled trials with 1,457 participants in a data marketplace scenario. The first group was treated with a PET, (MPC), the second group with a fictional PET, and the third with a non-PET, serving as a control group. Our findings reveal that user trust and data-sharing willingness increased with MPC and the fictional PET, indicating that the high-level description, rather than the technology name, shapes user perception. We conclude that claiming the use of a PET is not an effective method to measure the impact of actually using this technology. However, given their mental model, lay users cannot verify the privacy claims of such descriptions presented in studies or by service providers. This increases the risks of users being deceived into a false sense of privacy, leading them to expose more private data than they otherwise would. "

We tested our hypothesis by proposing possible censorship circumvention techniques that act on the TLS protocol. To validate the effectiveness of these techniques, we evaluate their acceptance by popular TLS servers and successfully demonstrate that these techniques can circumvent censors in China and Iran. In our evaluations, we discovered 38—partially standard-compliant—distinct censorship circumvention techniques, which we could group into 11 unique categories. Additionally, we provide novel insights into how China censors TLS traffic by presenting evidence of at least three distinct censorship appliances. We suspect that other parts of China’s censorship apparatus and other censors exhibit similar structures and advocate future censorship research to anticipate them. With this work, we hope to aid people affected by censorship and stimulate further research into censorship circumvention using cryptographic protocols. "

However, such endpoints are not always available in all countries that tamper with connections, leaving many networks unmeasurable.

We use Mint to conduct the first global measurements of network interference without using any participating endpoints, and the first comprehensive scans of IPv6 interference.

    "abstract": " Tor is the leading low-latency anonymous communication network, widely used to protect users' privacy through mechanisms such as random relay selection. However, despite these defenses, Tor traffic remains susceptible to website fingerprinting (WF) attacks, where attackers analyze side-channel information (e.g., packet size, direction, inter-packet timing) to infer visited websites. Although WF attacks have shown high success rates in controlled settings, they rely on complete, unperturbed traffic, making them vulnerable to real-world defense mechanisms. Traditional WF approaches, which typically employ Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) to classify packet sequences as a single-label prediction, struggle to generalize in practical scenarios, especially under defenses that alter packet patterns or in environments requiring multi-label, early-stage analysis. In this work, we introduce CountMamba, a robust and adaptable WF attack framework designed to address the challenges posed by real-world defenses, early-stage traffic analysis, and multi-tab browsing. CountMamba employs a Windowed Traffic Counting Matrix (WTCM) to create resilient, coarse-grained traffic representations by aggregating packet events within fixed time intervals, allowing it to withstand moderate perturbations from defenses. Additionally, a state-space-oriented (SSO) classifier incrementally generates fine-grained predictions from partial traffic data, maintaining high attack accuracy while enabling early-stage and multi-tab attack capabilities. Unlike prior WF methods, CountMamba iteratively updates predictions as new data arrives, eliminating the need for complete traffic capture and enabling reliable inference even in complex, multi-tab environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CountMamba outperforms state-of-the-art WF attacks across robust, early-stage, and multi-tab scenarios, highlighting its applicability for realistic, adaptive WF analysis in Tor networks.

    "abstract": " To circumvent the unbridled and ever-encroaching surveillance and censorship in cyberspace, steganography has garnered attention for its ability to hide private information in innocent-looking carriers. Current provably secure steganography approaches require a pair of encoder and decoder to hide and extract private messages, both of which must run the same model with the same input to obtain identical distributions. These requirements present significant challenges for the practical implementation of steganography. The majority of devices lack the computational resources to run a qualified model, and even a minor change to the model's input may result in incorrect extraction. To address this limitation, we propose a steganography framework for asymmetric resource scenarios. In such scenarios, the encoder is able to execute a qualified model to generate steganographic data, while the decoder is low-resource and is therefore able to extract hidden messages from the steganographic data without requiring either the model or model's input. This paper proposes a novel steganography framework with a rigorous proof of the security and robustness. A comprehensive assessment of applying our framework to generative models substantiates its efficacy. Our implementation demonstrates resilience when transmitting over binary symmetric channels with errors. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a practical and provably robust and secure steganography framework. "

We present Liquefaction, a wallet platform that demonstrates the dangerous fragility of this foundational assumption by systemically breaking it. Liquefaction uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) to encumber private keys, i.e., attach rich, multi-user policies to their use. In this way, it enables the cryptocurrency credentials and assets of a single end-user address to be freely rented, shared, or pooled. It accomplishes these things privately, with no direct on-chain traces. Liquefaction demonstrates the sweeping consequences of TEE-based key encumbrance for the cryptocurrency landscape. Liquefaction can undermine the security and economic models of many applications and resources, such as locked tokens, DAO voting, airdrops, loyalty points, soulbound tokens, and quadratic voting. It can do so with no on-chain and minimal off-chain visibility. Conversely, we also discuss beneficial applications of Liquefaction, such as privacy-preserving, cost-efficient DAOs and a countermeasure to dusting attacks. Importantly, we describe an existing TEE-based tool that applications can use as a countermeasure to Liquefaction.

    "abstract": " Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation. However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity. In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Specifically, we design a two-stage method to execute this attack. In the first stage, we optimize the input embedding with a constraint term derived from the LLM's embedding matrix to enforce the optimized embedding to be close to the ground truth. In the second stage, we accurately recover discrete tokens by incorporating activation calibration and semantic speculation. Our method is underpinned by a meticulous theoretical examination of inherent limitations in existing inversion methods, guiding our design of an optimal strategy for activation inversion attacks. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems. "

    "abstract": " Fine-tuning is an essential process to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specific domains, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) gaining popularity due to its capacity to reduce computational demands through the integration of low-rank adapters. These lightweight adapters, such as LoRA, can be shared and utilized on open-source platforms. However, adversaries could exploit this mechanism to inject backdoors into these adapters, resulting in malicious behaviors like incorrect or harmful outputs, which pose serious security risks to the community. Unfortunately, few current efforts concentrate on analyzing the backdoor patterns or detecting the backdoors in the adapters. To fill this gap, we first construct and release PADBench, a comprehensive benchmark that contains 13,300 benign and backdoored adapters fine-tuned with various datasets, attack strategies, PEFT methods, and LLMs. Moreover, we propose PEFTGuard, the first backdoor detection framework against PEFT-based adapters. Extensive evaluation upon PADBench shows that PEFTGuard outperforms existing detection methods, achieving nearly perfect detection accuracy (100%) in most cases. Notably, PEFTGuard exhibits zero-shot transferability on three aspects, including different attacks, PEFT methods, and adapter ranks. In addition, we consider various adaptive attacks to demonstrate the high robustness of PEFTGuard. We further explore several possible backdoor mitigation defenses, finding fine-mixing to be the most effective method. We envision that our benchmark and method can shed light on future LLM backdoor detection research. "

However, this combination of pre-training and downstream adaptation creates an expanded attack surface, exposing models to sophisticated backdoor embedding at both the encoder and dataset levels—an area often overlooked in prior research. Additionally, the limited computational resources typically available to users of pre-trained encoders constrain the effectiveness of generic backdoor defenses compared to end-to-end training from scratch. In this work, we investigate how to mitigate potential backdoor risks in resource-constrained transfer learning scenarios. Specifically, we first conduct an exhaustive analysis of existing defense strategies, revealing that many follow a reactive workflow based on assumptions that do not scale to unknown threats, novel attack types, or different training paradigms. In response, we introduce a proactive mindset focused on identifying clean elements and propose the Trusted Core (T-Core) Bootstrapping framework, which emphasizes the importance of pinpointing trustworthy data and neurons to enhance model security. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of T-Core, specifically assessing 5 encoder poisoning attacks, 7 dataset poisoning attacks, and 14 baseline defenses across 5 benchmark datasets, addressing 4 scenarios of 3 potential backdoor threats.

    "abstract": " The presence of non–independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients poses a critical challenge to the deployment of Federated Learning (FL) in practice. In response, state-of-the-art solutions known as Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) schemes, such as FL+HC and PACFL, have emerged to tackle this issue. Their main innovation is to cluster non-IID clients into groups of IID clients, such that techniques designated for IID scenarios can be easily applicable. Nonetheless, the robustness of CFL schemes remains largely unexplored, and existing Byzantine-robust defence mechanisms prove inadequate in CFL schemes and non-IID data settings. In this work, we present novel powerful CFL-specific poisoning attacks, named Cluster-U-M and Cluster-U-D. These attacks are designed to significantly reduce the model utility, measured in terms of test accuracy, for benign clients participating in the CFL schemes. Notably, these attacks remain agnostic, requiring no adversarial knowledge regarding defense solutions and benign clients themselves. At a high level, the attacks involve two steps, including cluster poisoning attacks and client-drift exploitation within clusters. The former induces the grouping of clients with different training distributions, and the latter amplifies the difference between each client's optimum and their group's average aggregation. We extensively evaluate the impact of these attacks using FL+HC and PACFL schemes on both small and large scales. The evaluation results demonstrate that the attacks can compromise up to 54% of clients, with a maximum accuracy loss of 48%. Even with only 0.1% clients compromised, which represents a minimal practical adversarial effort, these attacks can still victimize around 4% clients. We evaluate the effectiveness of two state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust defence mechanisms, i.e., FLTrust and FLAME, and find that the attacks can victimize up to 38% of clients with an accuracy loss of 18-38%.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of a previously understudied attack surface: firewall misconfigurations that inadvertently expose protected services to the public Internet. Specifically, we demonstrate flawed firewall rules that allow inbound connections from special source ports to bypass the firewall, and explore the prevalence and security implications thereof. To this end, we scan the IPv4 space for 15 commonly high-risk TCP and UDP services from two special source ports. Our measurement reveals the widespread existence of such misconfigurations and identified over 2,000,000 otherwise unreachable services spread over 15,837 autonomous systems, expanding the “observable Internet” for various protocols by up to 12.60%. More importantly, the affected services generally exhibit higher security risks than the publicly accessible ones, like outdated software versions and weak configurations. Despite the severity of this vulnerability, our honeypot experiment provides little evidence of active exploitation in the wild. Our findings offer insights for better security posture and network administration, helping researchers and organizations anticipate and mitigate potential cyber threats emanating from the Internet.

SYN PoW plays a similar role, but with several key advantages: (1) it protects bandwidth by dropping malicious SYNs without sending SYN-ACKs in response; (2) it facilitates in-network verification, enabling middleboxes to detect and drop malicious packets before they reach their target; (3) it shifts the primary cost burden of mitigation from attack victims to attackers themselves; and (4) it protects against spoofing attacks without requiring source address validation.

Yet, establishing cost-efficient and robust synchronization across geographically distributed devices is challenging. Many solutions for global time synchronization require placing trust in a single entity or system, for example in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSes) or leased infrastructure providers, constituting a single point of failure and often incurring high costs. An alternative, cost-effective solution is to run time synchronization over the Internet. However, this approach faces challenges in achieving (i) precise time synchronization, (ii) robustness to failing, misconfigured, or compromised nodes, and (iii) robustness to congestion-related issues such as volumetric DDoS attacks. Existing proposals mostly attempt to solve challenges (i) and (ii), but none provide robustness against congestion and volumetric DDoS. We address the challenges identified in previous work with Everdeen. Everdeen minimizes costs by running on existing Internet infrastructure and avoids relying on any single entity by enabling nodes to mutually synchronize time. The core innovation of Everdeen is its weighted neighbor-based (WNB) synchronization mode, where participants synchronize exclusively with their direct neighbors. Our evaluation shows that Everdeen provides better time synchronization quality at lower communication overhead compared to prior work. It is also considerably more robust against failing, misconfigured, or compromised hosts. Most importantly, we experimentally demonstrate that time synchronization traffic protected with Everdeen is unaffected by network congestion, including volumetric DDoS attacks. "

The proof of an $\\ell$-step computation is produced step-by-step such that the proof size nor the time to verify it depends on $\\ell$. The proof at the final iteration is then compressed, to achieve further succinctness in terms of proof size and verification time. Compared to prior folding-based arguments, a distinguishing aspect of MicroNova is the concrete efficiency of the verifier—even in a resource-constrained environment such as Ethereum’s blockchain. In particular, the compressed proof consists of $O(\\log{N})$ group elements and it can be verified with $O(\\log{N})$ group scalar multiplications and two pairing operations, where $N$ is the number of constraints for a single invocation of $F$. MicroNova requires a universal trusted setup and can employ any existing setup material created for the popular KZG univariate polynomial commitment scheme. Finally, we implement and experimentally evaluate MicroNova. We find that MicroNova’s proofs can be efficiently verified on the Ethereum blockchain with $\\approx2.2$M gas.

We identify two cryptographic design flaws in this protocol: a handshake that permits session-key replay and a non-standard integrity mechanism whose security critically depends on message confidentiality. We transform these vulnerabilities into an efficient plaintext-recovery attack by exploiting two ADNL communication patterns, allowing message reordering across replayed sessions. We then develop a plaintext model for this scenario and construct an efficient algorithm that recovers the keystream using a fraction of known plaintexts and a handful of replays. We implement our attack and show that an attacker intercepting the communication between a TON liteserver and a widely deployed ADNL client can recover the keystream used to encrypt server responses by performing eight connection replays to the server. This allows the decryption of sensitive data, such as account balances and user activity patterns. Additionally, the attacker can modify server responses to manipulate blockchain information displayed to the client, including account balances and asset prices. "

Many of these services realize a decentralized architecture with a threshold adversary to avoid a single point of failure and to mitigate key escrow issues. Although payments to such services are straightforward in systems that support smart contracts, achieving fairness poses challenges in systems like Bitcoin, which use the UTXO model with limited scripting capabilities. This is especially challenging without smart contracts, as we wish to pay only the required threshold of t + 1 out of the n servers offering the service, without any server claiming payment twice. In this paper, we introduce VITARIT, a novel payment solution tailored for threshold cryptographic services in UTXO systems like Bitcoin. Our approach guarantees robust, provable security while facilitating practical deployment. We focus on the t-out-of-n distributed threshold verifiable random function (VRF) service with certain properties, such as threshold BLS signatures, a recently highlighted area of interest. Our protocol enables clients to request verifiable random function (VRF) values from the threshold service, triggering payments to up to t+1 servers of the distributed threshold VRF. Our efficient design relies on simple transactions using signature verification scripts, making it immediately applicable in Bitcoin-like systems. We also introduce new tools and techniques at both the cryptographic and transaction layers, including a novel signature-VRF exchange protocol for standard constructions, which may be of independent interest. Additionally, our transaction flow design prevents malicious servers from claiming payments twice, offering broader implications for decentralized payment systems. Our prototype implementation shows that in the two-party interaction, the client takes 126.4msec, and the server takes 204msec, demonstrating the practicality and deployability of the system. "

However, LLMs can also answer questions that are unethical or harmful, raising concerns about their applications. To regulate LLMs' responses to such questions, a training strategy called alignment can help. Yet, alignment can be unexpectedly compromised when fine-tuning an LLM for downstream tasks. This paper focuses on recovering the alignment lost during fine-tuning. We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM: the aligned direction and the harmful direction. An LLM is inclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in the harmful direction. Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction of the fine-tuned model that has been compromised. Specifically, we restore a small subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original aligned model using gradient descent. We also introduce a rollback mechanism to avoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance. Our evaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their harmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25% to 1.74%, without sacrificing task performance much. In contrast, the existing methods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or significantly impact the normal functionality. "

In this work, we propose a new protocol for the SPDZ offline phase, TopGear 2.0, which improves upon the previous state-of-the-art construction, TopGear (Baum et al., SAC '19), and its variant for matrix triples (Chen et al., Asiacrypt '20). Our protocol aims to achieve a speedup in matrix triple generation and support for larger prime fields, up to 4096 bits in size. To achieve this, we devise a variant of the BFV scheme and a new homomorphic matrix multiplication algorithm optimized for our purpose. As a result, our protocol achieves about 3.6x speedup for generating scalar triples in a 1024-bit prime field and about 34x speedup for generating 128x128 matrix triples.

We achieve this in part by allowing for a mix of boolean and arithmetic values in FSS-based protocols (something not done in prior work), as well as by relying on “interactive FSS,” a generalization of FSS we introduce.

Training such models today increasingly relies on transfer learning, where models are pre-trained on large datasets and later fine-tuned for different domains, allowing the knowledge in the pre-trained model to be effectively reused and customized for these specific domains. However, such a learning paradigm also opens new attack surfaces on the fine-tuned model. Particularly, a privacy risk never studied before is the threat posed by the adversary affecting the pre-training process to the downstream user's private data for fine-tuning the model: A manipulated pre-trained model can render its fine-tuned version vulnerable to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks (MIAs) where the presence of a given sample in the fine-tuning dataset can be determined by querying the vulnerable model. A unique challenge in understanding this privacy risk is how to amplify the membership leakage while ensuring the performance of the fine-tuned model. To address this challenge, we introduce a new technique -- active robustness overfitting (ARO). This approach actively induces robustness overfitting during pre-training, which amplifies membership leakage in the downstream task without affecting its accuracy, while also maintaining the stealthiness of the attack. Our extensive evaluations across various datasets and diverse MIA scenarios demonstrate that our methods can effectively amplify membership leakage while preserving satisfactory downstream test accuracy, which contributes to a better understanding of the privacy risk introduced by transfer learning.

Using naive variants of differential privacy in such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work, we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees. "

Our findings reveal inconsistent practices in data sharing structure and documentation, causing some datasets to not be shared effectively. Additionally, reuse of datasets is low, especially in fields where the nature of the data does not lend itself to reuse. Based on our findings, we offer data-driven recommendations and resources for improving data sharing practices in our community.

    "abstract": " Due to the emerging privacy-protection laws and regulations (e.g. GDPR in the EU) in recent years, dozens of multi-party computation (MPC for short) protocols have been proposed and widely applied by companies and institutions. These MPC protocols enable companies and institutions to perform joint analyses and machine learning on their private data while protecting their data's privacy. However, due to the complexity of MPC protocols, their implementations often contain data leakage vulnerabilities, which can critically undermine the intended privacy protection. Additionally, most existing security analyses of MPC protocols rely on theoretical proofs, neglecting to detect possible vulnerabilities in MPC implementations. Therefore, detecting data leakage vulnerabilities in MPC implementations is an urgent necessity. In this paper, we propose MPCGuard, a practical framework for detecting data leakage vulnerabilities in MPC implementations. Different from traditional memory vulnerabilities, data leakage vulnerabilities in MPC implementations cannot be identified by existing sanitizers. To resolve this challenge, we first establish a leakage identifier in MPCGuard with two neural network classifiers to identify whether an MPC implementation contains data leakage vulnerabilities. To enhance identification effectiveness, the structures of neural network classifiers are designed according to the characteristics of MPC protocols. After identifying a data leakage vulnerability, we employ a delta method to assist in locating the vulnerability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MPCGuard, we apply MPCGuard to test 29 commonly-used MPC implementations in three main-stream MPC frameworks, i.e. Crypten, TF-Encrypted, and MP-SPDZ. We discover that 12 out of 29 implementations contain data leakage vulnerabilities, some of which can lead to the reconstruction of raw data. Until the moment this paper is written, all vulnerabilities, two of which have been assigned with CVE-IDs, have been confirmed. To the best of our knowledge, these two CVE-IDs are the first CVE-IDs assigned for data leakage vulnerabilities in MPC implementations. "

Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However, MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance overhead. Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output. Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a 1.94x-2.64x communication reduction. "

    "abstract": " Secure two-party computation (2PC) enables two parties to jointly evaluate a function while maintaining input privacy. Despite recent significant progress, a notable efficiency gap remains between actively secure and passively secure protocols. In S&P'12, Huang, Katz, and Evans formalized the notion of active security with one-bit leakage, providing a promising approach to bridging this gap. Protocols derived from this notion have become foundational in designing highly efficient actively secure 2PC protocols. However, a critical challenge identified by Huang, Katz, and Evans remains unexplored: these protocols face significant weaknesses in ensuring fairness for honest parties when employed in standalone settings rather than as components within larger protocols. While the authors proposed two potential solutions to mitigate this issue, both approaches are prohibitively expensive and lack formalization of security guarantees. In this paper, we first formally define an enhanced notion called active security with one-bit-advantage bound, in which the adversaries' advantages are strictly bounded to at most one bit beyond what honest parties obtain. This bound is enforced through a progressive revelation mechanism, where the evaluation result is disclosed incrementally bit by bit. In addition, we propose a novel approach leveraging label structures within garbled circuits to design a highly efficient constant-round 2PC protocol that achieves active security with one-bit advantage bound. Our protocol demonstrates runtime performance nearly identical to that of passively secure garbled-circuit counterparts in duplex networks (e.g., 1.033× for the SHA256 circuit in LAN), with low overhead for output progressive revelation (only 80 communicated bytes per bit release). With its strengthened security guarantees and minimal overhead, our protocol is highly suitable for practical 2PC applications. "

Public-key SE (PKSE) supports multi-user searches but suffers from high search latency due to expensive public-key operations. Symmetric SE (SSE) offers a sublinear search but is mainly limited to single-user settings. Recently, hybrid SE (HSE) has combined SSE and PKSE to achieve the best of both worlds, including multi-writer encrypted search functionalities, forward privacy, and sublinear search with respect to database size. Despite its advantages, HSE inherits critical security limitations, such as susceptibility to dictionary attacks, and still incurs significant overhead for search access control verification, requiring costly public-key operation invocations (i.e., pairing) across all authorized keywords. Additionally, its search access control component must be rebuilt periodically for forward privacy, imposing substantial writer overhead. In this paper, we propose Hermes, a new HSE scheme that addresses the aforementioned security issues in prior HSE designs while maintaining minimal search complexity and user efficiency at the same time. Hermes enables multi-writer encrypted search functionalities and offers forward privacy along with resilience to dictionary attacks. To achieve this, we develop a new identity-based encryption scheme with hidden identity and key-aggregate properties, which could be of independent interest. We also design novel partitioning and epoch encoding techniques in Hermes to minimize search complexity and offer low user overhead in maintaining forward privacy. We conducted intensive experiments to assess and compare the performance of Hermes and its counterpart on commodity hardware. Experimental results showed that Hermes performs search one to two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art HSE while offering stronger security guarantees to prevent dictionary and injection attacks.

To this end, we propose a security model to capture parties' inconsistent trust in TEEs and prove the security of our protocol under a simpler variant of the UC framework (SUC framework).

Given a threshold $t$ and a dataset of $n$ items from a domain of size $d$, such detection algorithms ignore items occurring fewer than $t$ times while identifying items occurring more than $t+\\Delta$ times; we call $\\Delta$ the \\emph{error margin}. In the central model where a curator holds the entire dataset, $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-DP algorithms can achieve error margin $\\Theta(\\frac 1 \\varepsilon \\log \\frac 1 \\delta)$, which is optimal when $d\\gg 1/\\delta$. Several works, e.g., Poplar (S\\&P 2021), have proposed protocols in which two or more non-colluding servers jointly compute the heavy hitters from inputs held by $n$ clients. Unfortunately, existing protocols suffer from an undesirable dependence on $\\log d$ in terms of both server efficiency (computation, communication, and round complexity) and accuracy (i.e., error margin), making them unsuitable for large domains (e.g., when items are kB-long strings, $\\log d \\approx 10^4$). We present \\emph{hash-prune-invert} (HPI), a technique for compiling any heavy-hitter protocol with the $\\log d$ dependencies mentioned above into a new protocol with improvements across the board: computation, communication, and round complexity depend (roughly) on $\\log n$ rather than $\\log d$, and the error margin is independent of $d$. Our transformation preserves privacy against an active adversary corrupting at most one of the servers and any number of clients. We apply HPI to an improved version of Poplar, also introduced in this work, that improves Poplar's error margin by roughly a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$ (regardless of $d$).

State-of-the-art methods minimize precise but expensive pointer tracking by falling back to so-called \"type analysis\" which scales well to large programs such as the Linux kernel. In this paper, we undertake an in-depth evaluation and analysis of type-based methods that reveal new insights into flaws due to their ad-hoc nature. First, we find that in a number of cases, the soundness claims of recent type-based methods do not hold, resulting in missing indirect call targets. Second, we find the analysis is overly conservative in multiple aspects, leading to a large number of false indirect call targets. Based on these insights, we make the observation that such type-based methods can be converted into a hybrid pointer analysis framework that unifies the traditional pointer tracking methods and type-based methods. Based on such a framework, we develop a practical indirect call analysis that addresses both soundness and precision limitations. Our results demonstrate a remarkable level of soundness and precision improvements. KallGraph simultaneously improves precision and soundness by pruning up to 90% of indirect call targets and eliminating hundreds to thousands of missed indirect calls. Finally, KallGraph is fully parallelizable and can complete the analysis of Linux kernels in times ranging from tens of minutes to a few hours. "

    "abstract": " Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique that can formally reason the correctness of program behaviors and detect software bugs. It can systematically explore the execution paths of the tested program. But it suffers from an inherent limitation: path explosion. Path explosion occurs when symbolic execution encounters an overwhelming number (exponential to the program size) of paths that need to be symbolically reasoned. It severely impacts the scalability and performance of symbolic execution. To tackle this problem, previous works leverage various heuristics to prioritize paths for symbolic execution. They rank the exponential number of paths using static rules or heuristics and explore the paths with the highest rank. However, in practice, these works often fail to generalize to diverse programs. In this work, we propose a novel and effective path prioritization technique with path cover, named Empc. Our key insight is that not all paths need to be symbolically reasoned. Unlike traditional path prioritization, our approach leverages a small subset of paths as a minimum path cover (MPC) that can cover all code regions of the tested programs. To encourage diversity in path prioritization, we compute multiple MPCs. We then guide the search for symbolic execution on the small number of paths inside multiple MPCs rather than the exponential number of paths. We implement our technique Empc based on KLEE. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Empc to investigate its performance in code coverage, bug findings, and runtime overhead. The evaluation shows that Empc can cover 19.6% more basic blocks than KLEE's best search strategy and 24.4% more lines compared to the state-of-the-art work cgs. Empc also finds 24 more security violations than KLEE's best search strategy. Meanwhile, Empc can significantly reduce the memory usage of KLEE by up to 93.5% and reduce the number of symbolic states by up to 88.6%. "

However, traditional evaluation methods often overlook specific cybersecurity knowledge gaps that contribute to performance limitations. To address this, we develop CSEBenchmark, a fine-grained cybersecurity evaluation framework based on 345 knowledge points expected of cybersecurity experts. Drawing from cognitive science, these points are categorized into factual, conceptual, and procedural types, enabling the design of 11,050 tailored multiple-choice questions. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs on CSEBenchmark and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 85.42% overall accuracy, with particular knowledge gaps in the use of specialized tools and uncommon commands. Different LLMs have unique knowledge gaps. Even large models from the same family may perform poorly on knowledge points where smaller models excel. By identifying and addressing specific knowledge gaps in each LLM, we achieve up to an 84% improvement in correcting previously incorrect predictions across three existing benchmarks for two cybersecurity tasks. Furthermore, our assessment of each LLM's knowledge alignment with specific cybersecurity roles reveals that different models align better with different roles, such as GPT-4o for the Google Senior Intelligence Analyst and Deepseek-V3 for the Amazon Privacy Engineer. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM selection with the specific knowledge requirements of different cybersecurity roles for optimal performance. "

    "abstract": " Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. It can be used where the users’ information are to be processed by an untrustful server, and has been a popular choice in privacy-preserving applications. However, in order to obtain meaningful results, we have to assume an honest-but-curious server, i.e., it will faithfully follow what was asked to do. If the server is malicious, there is no guarantee that the computed result is correct. The notion of verifiable HE (vHE) is introduced to detect malicious server’s behaviors, but current vHE schemes are either more than four orders of magnitude slower than the underlying HE operations (Atapoor et. al, CIC 2024) or fast but incompatible with server- side private inputs (Chatel et. al, CCS 2024). In this work, we propose a vHE framework ZHE: efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) that prove the correct execution of HE evaluations while protecting the server’s private inputs. More precisely, we first design two new highly- efficient ZKPs for modulo operations and (Inverse) Number Theoretic Transforms (NTTs), two of the basic operations of HE evaluations. Then we build a customized ZKP for HE evaluations, which is scalable, enjoys a fast prover time and has a non-interactive online phase. Our ZKP is applicable to all Ring-LWE based HE schemes, such as BGV and CKKS. Finally, we implement our protocols for both BGV and CKKS and conduct extensive experiments on various HE workloads. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, both of our prover time and verifier time are improved; especially, our prover cost is only roughly 27-36× more expensive than the underlying HE operations, this is two to three orders of magnitude cheaper than state-of-the-arts.

    "abstract": " General-purpose probabilistic proof systems operate on programs expressed as systems of arithmetic constraints---an unfriendly representation. There are two broad approaches in the literature to turning friendlier, high-level programs into constraints suitable for proof systems: direct translation and CPU emulation. Direct translators compile a program into highly optimized constraints; unfortunately, this process requires expressing all possible paths through the program, which results in compile times that scale with the program's runtime rather than its size. In addition, the prover must pay the cost of every possible program path, even those untaken by a given input. In contrast, CPU emulators don't compile programs to constraints; instead, they \"execute\" those programs, expressed as CPU instructions, on a CPU emulator that is itself expressed as constraints. As a result, this approach can't perform powerful, program-specific optimizations, and may require thousands of constraints where direct translation could use a clever handful. Worse, CPU emulators inherit an impractically expensive program state representation from the CPUs they emulate. This paper presents a compiler and proof system, CoBBl, that combines the benefits of CPU emulation and direct translation: it takes advantage of program-specific optimizations, but doesn't pay for an unnecessary state representation or unexecuted computation. CoBBl outperforms CirC, a state-of-the-art direct translator, by 1--30x on compile time and 26--350x on prover time, and outperforms Jolt, a state-of-the-art CPU emulator, on prover time by 1.1--1.8x on Jolt-friendly benchmarks, and up to 100x on other benchmarks.

    "abstract": " In recent years, online anonymity has become increasingly important but is under threat due to the challenges of moderating anonymous spaces. A promising cryptographic solution, known as anonymous blocklisting, allows users to post anonymously while still enabling moderation. Moderation via anonymous blocklisting roughly works by requiring that when users post a message they attach a cryptographic proof that they did not author any posts on a “blocklist”. Existing anonymous blocklisting schemes are unfortunately still far from achieving practical performance for large blocklists. This is essentially due to all prior works requiring a user to (cryptographically) reprocess blocklist entries many times. Relatedly, prior works have relatively high verification times and proof sizes. In this work, we introduce ALPACA, the first anonymous blocklisting system with the property that a user only needs to do a constant amount of work per blocklist entry. Thus, our scheme has asymptotically optimal performance. Our scheme is also the first to have verification times and proof sizes that are independent of the number of blocklist entries. Our key technique is a new variant of incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), designed to ensure anonymity. Along the way, we introduce new definitions to formally establish security. On a mid-range laptop, ALPACA’s proof generation time is always 6.15 seconds and proof size is 25.6KBs. On a server, the verification time is always 400ms. "

Among them, zero-knowledge SNARKs are notable for their compact and efficiently-verifiable proofs, but suffer from high prover costs. Wu et al. (Usenix Security 2018) proposed to distribute the proving task across multiple machines, and achieved significant improvements in proving time. However, existing distributed ZKP systems still have quasi-linear prover cost, and may incur a communication cost that is linear in circuit size. In this paper, we introduce HyperPianist. Inspired by the state-of-the-art distributed ZKP system Pianist (Liu et al., S&P 2024) and the multivariate proof system HyperPlonk (Chen et al., EUROCRYPT 2023), we design a distributed multivariate polynomial interactive oracle proof (PIOP) system with a linear-time prover cost and logarithmic communication cost. Unlike Pianist, HyperPianist incurs no extra overhead in prover time or communication when applied to general (non-data-parallel) circuits. To instantiate the PIOP system, we adapt two additively-homomorphic multivariate polynomial commitment schemes, multivariate KZG (Papamanthou et al., TCC 2013) and Dory (Lee et al., TCC 2021), into the distributed setting, and get HyperPianist^K and HyperPianist^D respectively. Both systems have linear prover complexity and logarithmic communication cost; furthermore, HyperPianist^D requires no trusted setup. We also propose HyperPianist+, incorporating an optimized lookup argument based on Lasso (Setty et al., EUROCRYPT 2024) with lower prover cost. Experiments demonstrate HyperPianist^K and HyperPianist^D achieve speedups of 63.1x and 40.2x over HyperPlonk with 32 distributed machines. Compared to Pianist, HyperPianist^K can be 2.9x and 4.6x as fast and HyperPianist^D can be 2.4x and 3.8x as fast, on vanilla gates and custom gates respectively.

We introduce JesseQ, a suite of two VOLE-based protocols: JQv1 and JQv2, which advance state of the art. JQv1 requires only 2 scalar multiplications in an extension field per AND gate for Boolean circuits, with one scalar needing a O(κ)- bit operation, and 2 field multiplications per multiplication gate for arithmetic circuits over a large field. In terms of communication costs, JQv1 needs just 1 field element per gate. JQv2 further reduces communication costs by half at the cost of doubling the prover’s computation. Experiments show that, compared to the current state of the art, both JQv1 and JQv2 achieve at least 3.9× improvement in the online phase for Boolean circuits. For large field circuits, JQv1 has a similar performance, while JQv2 offers a 1.3× improvement. Additionally, both JQv1 and JQv2 maintain the same communication cost as the current state of the art. Noably, on the cheapest AWS instances, JQv1 can prove 9.2 trillion AND gates (or 5.8 trillion multiplication gates over a 61-bit field) for just one US dollar. JesseQ excels in applications like inner products, matrix multiplication, and lattice problems, delivering 40% − 200% performance improvements compared to QuickSilver.

To the best of our knowledge, all prior VC schemes either achieve (i) but are not efficiently pluggable'' into zkSNARKs (e.g., a Merkle tree commitment that requires re-computing the entire hash tree inside the circuit), or achieve (ii) but take (NlogN) time. We then combine HydraProofs with the seminal GKR protocol and apply the resulting zkSNARK in a setting where multiple users participate in a computation executed by an untrusted server and each user wants to ensure the correctness of the result and that her data was included. Our experimental evaluation shows our approach outperforms prior ones by 4-16x for prover times on general circuits. Finally, we consider two concrete application use cases, verifiable secret sharing and verifiable robust aggregation. For the former, our construction achieves the first scheme for Shamir's secret sharing with linear time prover (lower than the time needed for the dealer computation). For the second we propose a scheme that works against misbehaving aggregators and our experiments show it can be reasonably deployed in existing schemes with minimal slow-downs. "

    "abstract": " With the rise of machine learning techniques, ensuring the fairness of decisions made by machine learning algorithms has become of great importance in critical applications. However, measuring fairness often requires full access to the model parameters, which compromises the confidentiality of the models. In this paper, we propose a solution using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows the model owner to convince the public that a machine learning model is fair while preserving the secrecy of the model. To circumvent the efficiency barrier of naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key innovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and some aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To achieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression and deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the fairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness, including the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and fixed-point arithmetic. We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning fairness in zero-knowledge. Experimental results show that FairZK is significantly faster than the naive approach and an existing scheme that use zero-knowledge inferences as a subroutine. The prover time is improved by 3.1~1789 times depending on the size of the model and the dataset. FairZK can scale to a large model with 47 million parameters for the first time, and generates a proof for its fairness in 343 seconds. This is estimated to be 4 orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, which only scale to small models with hundreds to thousands of parameters. "

CPU caches are an essential but complex element in many microarchitectural attacks, making it crucial to understand the inner workings. Despite progress in reverse-engineering techniques, non-linear cache-slice functions remain challenging to analyze, especially in recent Intel hybrid microarchitectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach towards reverse-engineering complex, non-linear cache-slice functions, particularly on modern Intel CPUs with hybrid microarchitectures. Our method significantly advances prior work by understanding the specific structure of microarchitectural hash functions, reducing the time required for reverse-engineering from days to minutes. In contrast to prior work, our technique successfully handles systems with 512 GB of memory and diverse slice configurations. We present 17 newly identified functions used for cache-slice addressing and extend existing functions to support systems with more DRAM for multiple CPU generations. Additionally, we introduce an unprivileged virtual-to-physical address oracle that is a direct consequence of the complexity of the non-linear slice functions. Our method is particularly effective on modern Intel hybrid CPUs, including Alder Lake and Meteor Lake, where previously used methods for measuring slices or leaking physical addresses are unavailable. In 3 case studies, we validate our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in executing targeted Spectre attacks on non-attacker-mapped memory, enabling DRAMA attacks, and creating cache eviction sets.

    "abstract": " Despite nearly a decade of mitigation efforts by both industry and academia, the community has yet to find comprehensive and efficient countermeasures against pernicious hardware vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Rowhammer. While Spectre mitigations have mostly focused on patching dangerous disclosure gadgets in high-value codebases such as the Linux kernel, mitigating Rowhammer in software is still challenging and security often hinges on the (im)practicality of real-world attacks. Indeed, some Rowhammer attacks are entirely nondeterministic, triggering random bit flips in the hope of corrupting victim data—but at the risk of corrupting critical data and crashing the system. More reliable attacks rely on techniques such as memory templating and massaging, but achieving fully deterministic behavior is still difficult in face of complex memory management abstractions in both hardware and software. In this paper, we show that fully deterministic Rowhammer attacks are feasible. To this end, we exploit synergies with Spectre and specifically focus our attention on so-called half-Spectre gadgets. We show these gadgets, previously deemed unexploitable on last-generation CPUs due to their inability to directly disclose secret data, do enable powerful disclosure primitives to harden other attacks such as Rowhammer. Specifically, we use half-Spectre gadgets to build PRELOAD+TIME, a generic primitive to monitor a controlled victim’s physical memory activity at the cache line granularity, without sharing memory with the victim. We use this capability to craft ProbeHammer, the first crash-free end-to-end Rowhammer exploit that does not rely on templating or massaging. In detail, we spray physical memory with aggressor (i.e., user) and victim (i.e., page table) data and disclose their location with PRELOAD+TIME. This primitive allows us to select safe hammering patterns and avoid unintended bit flips that may crash the system. Our evaluation confirms ProbeHammer attacks yield no false positives (hence, no crashes) by construction and can compromise real-world systems in a matter of hours. "

An emerging class of these attacks exploits remote methods to monitor power consumption—most notably by observing power-dependent CPU frequency variations. However, existing methods have only been demonstrated on (older) x86 CPU architectures where frequency scaling is the primary—if not only—mechanism utilized to keep the system within safe operating conditions. It remains unclear whether remote power side-channel attacks are still feasible on modern x86 CPU architectures with additional, more sophisticated such mechanisms. We demonstrate that not only do remote power-side channel attacks remain feasible on modern x86 CPU architectures, but that they are also more effective and work even in the absence of frequency side-channel leakage. Our attacks take advantage of Thread Director, a hardware optimization that provides scheduling \"hints\" to enhance performance and energy efficiency on modern Intel processors. We demonstrate that these hints depend on the processor's power consumption, leading to power-dependent scheduling behaviors—such as variations in the number of active cores—that can be observed purely from software and even via remote-timing analysis.

In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of \\textit{syncfs}, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a \\textit{syncfs} covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows.

The current, enhanced version introduces mechanisms to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Enabling these security-enhancing mechanisms, however, results in a variable-structured, context-sensitive packet format that can be challenging to parse and interpret correctly. Misparsing SAE handshake packets can negatively impact Wi-Fi protocol security. To uncover SAE handshake packet misparsing in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi access points (APs), we present SAECRED, a packet-structure-guided, SAE-state-aware black-box fuzzer. SAECRED reduces the underlying problem of misparsing discovery to a two-dimensional search problem, where the dimensions are the packet structure and the underlying SAE protocol state. It solves this search problem by combining Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) with a context-sensitive grammar-based fuzzing approach, where the latter relies on a Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) solver. SAECRED’s effectiveness is demonstrated by evaluating it on 6 COTS APs and the widely used open-source hostapd. Our evaluation discovered several instances of 4 classes of bugs.

However, existing fuzzing approaches commonly encounter three overlooked obstacles stemming from firmware service characteristics, which largely hinder the effectiveness and efficiency of vulnerability identification. Firstly, the multi-process nature of firmware services is oversimplified during both the emulation and the fuzzing procedures, limiting the scope of firmware testing. Furthermore, firmware services usually incorporate customized service protocols, which feature rich and stringent semantic constraints, causing unique challenges for input generation. To address these obstacles, this paper proposes a service-aware greybox fuzzing tool HouseFuzz. During the firmware emulation, HouseFuzz carefully traverses the system initialization procedure for identifying those network-facing and daemon processes overlooked by existing approaches. After that, during the fuzzing procedure, HouseFuzz features a multi-process fuzzing framework, enabling the comprehensive inspection of firmware services activated via multiple processes. Furthermore, HouseFuzz leverages both offline and online firmware service analysis to capture the token-level semantic constraints of customized service protocols, based on which HouseFuzz can effectively generate high-quality test cases. In evaluation, compared to SoTA grey-box firmware fuzzing approaches, HouseFuzz identified 76% more network services, achieved 24.8% more code coverage, and detected 175% more 0-day vulnerabilities on the same firmware dataset.

    "abstract": " Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is the predominant privacy model for safeguarding individual data privacy. Existing perturbation mechanisms typically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy, which inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this work, we propose an alternative approach --- instead of perturbing values, we apply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP guarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD for answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a multi-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully scalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements and domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing methods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its superiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.

    "abstract": " Differentially private selection mechanisms offer strong privacy guarantees for queries aiming to identify the top-scoring element r from a finite set R, based on a dataset-dependent utility function. While selection queries are fundamental in data science, few mechanisms effectively ensure their privacy. Furthermore, most approaches rely on global sensitivity to achieve differential privacy (DP), which can introduce excessive noise and impair downstream inferences. To address this limitation, we propose the Smooth Noisy Max (SNM) mechanism, which leverages smooth sensitivity to yield provably tighter (upper bounds on) expected errors compared to global sensitivity-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate that SNM is more accurate than state-of-the-art differentially private selection methods in three applications: percentile selection, greedy decision trees, and random forests.

    "abstract": " Generative models producing synthetic data are meant to provide a privacy-friendly approach to releasing data. However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline. "

Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing industry-standard CPU-based TEEs, such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV, do not adequately protect these accelerators. Device-TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals target specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose GuardAIn, a confidential computing architecture for discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. GuardAIn secures data, model parameters, and operator binaries through authenticated encryption. GuardAIn uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation guarantees strong model integrity.

    "abstract": " Recent works have repeatedly proven the practicality of side-channel attacks in undermining the confidentiality guarantees of Trusted Execution Environments such as Intel SGX. Meanwhile, the trusted execution in the cloud is witnessing a trend shift towards confidential virtual machines (CVMs). Unfortunately, several side-channel attacks have survived the shift and are feasible even for CVMs, along with the new attacks discovered on the CVM architectures. Previous works have explored defensive measures for securing userspace enclaves (i.e., Intel SGX) against side-channel attacks. However, the design space for a CVM-based obfuscation execution engine is largely unexplored. This paper proposes a unikernel design named IncognitOS to provide full-system obfuscation for CVM-based cloud workloads. IncognitOS fully embraces unikernel principles such as minimized TCB and direct hardware access to render full-system obfuscation feasible. IncognitOS retrofits two key OS components, the scheduler and memory management, to implement a novel adaptive obfuscation scheme. IncognitOS's scheduling is designed to be self-sovereign from the timer interrupts from the untrusted hypervisor with its synchronous tick delivery. This allows IncognitOS to reliably monitor the frequency of the hypervisor's possession of execution control (i.e., VMExits) and adjust the frequency of memory rerandomization performed by the paging subsystem, which transparently performs memory rerandomization through direct MMU access. The resulting IncognitOS design makes a case for self-obfuscating unikernel as a secure CVM deployment strategy while further advancing the obfuscation technique compared to previous works. Evaluation results demonstrate IncognitOS's resilience against CVM attacks and show that its adaptive obfuscation scheme enables practical performance for real-world programs. "

Apple introduced a new feature since iOS 15.2, App Privacy Report, to inform users about detailed insights into apps' data access and sharing. This feature continues Apple's trend of privacy-focused innovations (following Privacy Nutrition Labels), and has been marketed as a big step forward in user privacy.

We thus proposed an end-to-end study involving systematic assessment of the App Privacy Report's real-world benefits and limitations, LLM-enabled and multi-technique synthesized enhancements, and comprehensive evaluation from both system and user perspectives. Through a structured focus group study with twelve everyday iOS users, we explored their experiences, understanding, and perceptions of the feature, suggesting its limited practical impact resulting from missing important details. We identified two primary user concerns: the clarity of data access purpose and domain description.

In these environments, head-mounted displays (HMDs) enable users to interact with virtual objects through head and hand tracking. In particular, virtual keyboards are emerging as a primary input method, allowing users to type directly with their hands---eliminating the need for additional devices and adding convenience for portable HMD use. However, this direct hand-based typing introduces new security concerns, namely \\textit{subtle head movements that occur during direct hand-based typing can unintentionally reveal private information.} In this paper, we propose \\textsc{SnoopFinger}, a novel side-channel attack that leverages head movement data, which is accessible without additional user permissions, to estimate typed inputs on a virtual keyboard. Unlike previous methods, \\textsc{SnoopFinger} uniquely employs a \\textit{cross-modality} approach, relying solely on \\textit{head} movement data to infer \\textit{hand}-typed inputs without the use of controllers. Additionally, our approach is designed to identify a victim's typed inputs without requiring prior access to extensive head movement data from the victim or other users.

    "abstract": " Modern secure communication systems, such as iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal include intricate mechanisms that aim to achieve very strong security properties. These mechanisms typically involve continuously merging in new fresh secrets into the keying material, which is used to encrypt messages during communications. In the literature, these mechanisms have been proven to achieve forms of Post-Compromise Security (PCS): the ability to provide communication security even if the full state of a party was compromised some time in the past. However, recent work has shown these proofs do not transfer to the end-user level, possibly because of usability concerns. This has raised the question of whether end-users can actually obtain PCS or not, and under which conditions. Here we show and formally prove that communication systems that need to be resilient against certain types of state loss (which can occur in practice) fundamentally cannot achieve full PCS for end-users. Whereas previous work showed that the Signal messenger did not achieve this with its current session-management layer, we isolate the exact conditions that cause this failure, and why this cannot be simply solved in communication systems by implementing a different session-management layer or an entirely different protocol. Moreover, we clarify the trade-off of the maximum number of sessions between two users (40 in Signal) in terms of failure-resilience versus security. Our results have direct consequences for the design of future secure communication systems, and could motivate either the simplification of redundant mechanisms, or the improvement of session-management designs to provide better security trade-offs with respect to state loss/failure tolerance.

We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones—where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97% from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio. "

Recent works have investigated latency attacks against perception pipelines, which can lead to a Denial-of-Service against the autonomous system. Unfortunately, these attacks lack real-world applicability, either relying on digital perturbations or requiring large, unscalable, and highly visible patches that cover up the victim's view. In this paper, we propose DetStorm, a novel physically realizable latency attack against camera-based perception. DetStorm uses projector perturbations to cause delays in perception by creating a large number of adversarial objects. These objects are optimized on four objectives to evade filtering by multiple Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) approaches. To maximize the number of created objects in a dynamic physical environment, DetStorm takes a unique greedy approach, segmenting the environment into \"zones\" containing distinct object classes and maximizing the number of created objects per zone. DetStorm adapts to changes in the environment in real time, recombining perturbation patterns via our zone stitching process into a contiguous, physically projectable image. Evaluations in both simulated and real-world experiments show that DetStorm causes a 506% increase in detected objects on average, delaying perception results by up to 8.1 seconds, and capable of causing physical consequences on real-world autonomous driving systems.

Compared to previous cryptographic methods for image authentication, Eva is not only capable of handling significantly larger amounts of data originating from the complex lossy video encoding but also achieves linear prover time, constant RAM usage, and constant proof size with respect to video size. These improvements have optimal theoretic complexity and are enabled by our two new theoretical advancements of integrating lookup arguments with folding-based incrementally verifiable computation (IVC) and compressing IVC proof efficiently, which may be of independent interest. For our implementation of Eva, we then integrate them with the Nova folding scheme, which we call Lova. As for concrete performance, we additionally utilize various optimizations such as tailored circuit design and GPU acceleration to make Eva highly practical: for a 2-minute HD (1280×720) video encoded in H.264 at 30 frames per second, Eva generates a 448 B proof in about 2.4 hours on consumer-grade hardware at 2.6 μs per pixel, surpassing state-of-the-art cryptographic image authentication schemes by more than an order of magnitude in terms of prover time and proof size.

    "abstract": " The advent of voice cloning has fundamentally threatened the role of voice as a unique biometric. Many criminal incidents have already been reported to demonstrate its significant risks of identity forgery. Previous works explored the risks of voice cloning in constrained settings, which require victim speakers to either be already seen in the training data of voice cloning models, or leak dozens of minutes of their speech samples to adversaries. However, with the rapid progress of voice cloning in the AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) era, these requirements have largely been released, leaving the exact risks of state-of-the-art (SOTA) voice cloning techniques shrouded in a dense fog. To uncover it, this paper conducts a large-scale study in real-world scenarios to assess the risks of advanced voice cloning techniques. This study involves 5 SOTA voice cloning techniques (open-source and commercial), across 8 SOTA voice authentication systems (open-source and real-world) and 30 human listeners, using voice data of over 7,000 speakers (public and custom). By experimental and theoretical analysis, this study reveals that 1) state-of-the-art voice cloning techniques pose severe threats in spoofing voice authentication systems and human listeners; 2) demographic factors such as age and gender of victim speakers have a subtle impact on voice cloning attacks; 3) human listeners’ subjective opinions and background about voice cloning play an important role in their susceptibility to attacks; 4) advanced detection methods still fail to identify voice cloning samples as expected.
