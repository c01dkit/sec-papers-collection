    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/wang-jianqiang",
    "abstract": "Fuzzing has proven to be an effective method for discovering vulnerabilities in firmware images. However, several hard-to-bypass obstacles still block the way for fuzzers to achieve higher code coverage in the firmware fuzzing process. One major issue is interrupt handling, which is fundamental to emulate the firmware: If interrupts are triggered incorrectly, the firmware may crash or get stuck, even at an early stage. Thus, a proper mechanism for triggering and handling interrupts is a crucial yet under-researched aspect of firmware fuzzing. In this paper, we present AidFuzzer, an adaptive interrupt-driven firmware fuzzing method, to tackle the interrupt triggering problem. The key observation is that firmware images commonly exhibit a consistent run-time state transition cycle. In each state, the firmware may require specific interrupts to continue running, or it may not need any interrupts to continue processing data. Based on this observation, we model the type and status of the interrupts to verify that they are exactly the interrupts that the firmware needs at a specific point in time. Moreover, we monitor the run-time state of the firmware and trigger certain interrupts when the firmware expects them or let the firmware run when it does not require interrupts. We have implemented a prototype of AidFuzzer and evaluated it on 10 open-source firmware projects, including well-known real-time operating systems such as RT-Thread and Apache Mynewt-OS. The experiment demonstrates that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art works in terms of coverage when dealing with complex interrupt handling. We also discovered eight previously unknown vulnerabilities in the tested firmware images."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/gu-xiaolan",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple participating clients to train machine learning models collaboratively while keeping their datasets local and only exchanging the gradient or model updates with a coordinating server. Existing FL protocols are vulnerable to attacks that aim to compromise data privacy and/or model robustness. Recently proposed defenses focused on ensuring either privacy or robustness, but not both. In this paper, we focus on simultaneously achieving differential privacy (DP) and Byzantine robustness for cross-silo FL, based on the idea of learning from history. The robustness is achieved via client momentum, which averages the updates of each client over time, thus reducing the variance of the honest clients and exposing the small malicious perturbations of Byzantine clients that are undetectable in a single round but accumulate over time. In our initial solution DP-BREM, DP is achieved by adding noise to the aggregated momentum, and we account for the privacy cost from the momentum, which is different from the conventional DP-SGD that accounts for the privacy cost from the gradient. Since DP-BREM assumes a trusted server (who can obtain clients' local models or updates), we further develop the final solution called DP-BREM+, which achieves the same DP and robustness properties as DP-BREM without a trusted server by utilizing secure aggregation techniques, where DP noise is securely and jointly generated by the clients. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed protocols achieve better privacy-utility tradeoff and stronger Byzantine robustness than several baseline methods, under different DP budgets and attack settings."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/sasaki",
    "abstract": "There is an expectation that users of home IoT devices will be able to secure those devices, but they may lack information about what they need to do. In February 2022, we launched a web service that scans users' IoT devices to determine how secure they are. The service aims to diagnose and remediate vulnerabilities and malware infections of IoT devices of Japanese users. This paper reports on findings from operating this service drawn from three studies: (1) the engagement of 114,747 users between February, 2022 - May, 2024; (2) a large-scale evaluation survey among service users (n=4,103), and; (3) an investigation and targeted survey (n=90) around the remediation actions of users of non-secure devices. During the operation, we notified 417 (0.36%) users that one or more of their devices were detected as vulnerable, and 171 (0.15%) users that one of their devices was infected with malware. The service found no issues for 99% of users. Still, 96% of all users evaluated the service positively, most often for it providing reassurance, being free of charge, and short diagnosis time. Of the 171 users with malware infections, 67 returned to the service later for a new check, with 59 showing improvement. Of the 417 users with vulnerable devices, 151 users revisited and re-diagnosed, where 75 showed improvement. We report on lessons learned, including a consideration of the capabilities that non-expert users will assume of a security scan."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/liu-xiaofeng",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the ubiquity of mobile infrastructures promote the prevalence of BLE proximity tracking services (e.g., Apple Find My and Samsung Find My Mobile) that use the proximity measured from other surrounding mobile devices (e.g., smartphones). Accordingly, it raises severe security and privacy concerns that are inherent to the basis of the technique (i.e., BLE) and the design of the proximity tracking protocol on top of it. Unfortunately, a systematic and comprehensive analysis of these protocols is still missing since the analysis of these protocols in existing research either focuses on a single participant in the service or lacks formal guarantees. As such, in this paper, we aim to fill in the missing piece by (1) recovering the closed-source protocol via reverse engineering; (2) building formal models based on reverse engineering; (3) extracting and formalizing the designed security goals of these protocols, and (4) formally verifying whether these security goals can be guaranteed. We reverse-engineered and verified two of the most popular real-world proximity tracking services, i.e., Apple Find My and Samsung Find My Mobile. In total, our analysis reveals seven new vulnerabilities confirmed by related vendors, out of which, four CVE/SVE numbers are assigned, including three high-severity vulnerabilities. We also propose mitigations to the discovered vulnerabilities and formally confirm that all security goals can be achieved with our mitigations. At the time of paper writing, Samsung has fixed five vulnerabilities with our assistance."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/agarwal",
    "abstract": "SMS fraud has surged in recent years. Detection techniques have improved along with the fraud, necessitating harder-to-detect fraud techniques. We study one of these where scammers send an SMS to the victim addressing mum or dad, pretend to be their child, and ask for financial help. Unlike previous SMS phishing techniques, successful scammers interact with victims, rather than sending only one message which contains a URL. This recent impersonation technique has proven to be more effective worldwide and has been named hi mum and dad' SMS scam. In this paper, we collaborate with a UK-based mobile network operator to access the initialhi mum and dad' scam messages and related user spam reports. We then interact with suspicious scammers pretending to be potential victims. This is the first work empirically studying this particular scam. We collect 582 unique mule accounts from 711 scammer interactions where scammers ask us to pay more than Â£577k over three months. We find that scammers deceive their victims mainly by using kindness and distraction principles followed by the time principle. The paper presents how they abuse the services provided by mobile network operators and financial institutions to conduct this scam. We then provide suggestions to mitigate this cybercriminal operation."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/solt",
    "abstract": "We introduce MIRTL, a confused deputy attack on EDA software such as simulators or synthesizers. MIRTL relies on gadgets that exploit vulnerabilities in the EDA software's translation of RTL to lower-level representations. Invisible to white-box testing and verification methods, MIRTL gadgets harden traditional hardware trojans, enabling unprecedentedly stealthy attacks. To discover translation bugs, our new fuzzer, called TRANSFUZZ, generates randomized RTL designs containing many operators with complex interconnections for triggering translation bugs. The expressiveness of RTL, however, makes the construction of a golden RTL model for detecting deviations due to translation bugs challenging. To address this, TRANSFUZZ relies on comparing signal outputs from multiple RTL simulators for detecting vulnerabilities. TRANSFUZZ uncovers 20 translation vulnerabilities among 31 new bugs (25 CVEs) in four popular open-source EDA applications. We show how MIRTL gadgets harden traditional backdoors against white-box countermeasures and demonstrate a real-world instance of a MIRTL-hardened backdoor in the CVA6 RISC-V core."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/luo",
    "abstract": "Integration Platforms such as Workflow Automation Platforms, Virtual Assistants and Smart Homes are becoming an integral part of the Internet. These platforms welcome third-parties to develop and distribute apps in their open marketplaces, and support \"account linking\" to connect end-users' app accounts to their platform account. This enables the platform to orchestrate a wide range of external services on behalf of the end-users. While OAuth is the de facto standard for account linking, the open nature of integration platforms poses new threats, as their OAuth architecture could be exploited by untrusted integrated apps.\nIn this paper, we examine the flawed designs of multi-app OAuth authorizations that support account linking in integration platforms. We unveil two new platform-wide attacks due to the lack of app differentiation: Cross-app OAuth Account Takeover (COAT) and Request Forgery (CORF). As long as a victim end-user establishes account linking with a malicious app, or potentially with just a click on a crafted link, they risk unauthorized access or privacy leakage of any apps on the platform.\nTo facilitate systematic discovery of vulnerabilities, we develop COVScan, a semi-automated black-box testing tool that profiles varied OAuth designs to identify cross-app vulnerabilities in real-world platforms. Our measurement study reveals that among 18 popular consumer- or enterprise-facing integration platforms, 11 are vulnerable to COAT and another 5 to CORF, including those built by Microsoft, Google and Amazon. The vulnerabilities render widespread impact, leading to unauthorized control over end-users' services and devices, covert logging of sensitive information, and compromising a major ecosystem in single click (a CVE with CVSS 9.6). We responsibly reported the vulnerabilities and collaborated with the affected vendors to deploy comprehensive solutions."

    "abstract": "The usage of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models in edge devices (e.g., IoT devices) has surged. In this usage scenario, the inference phase of the DNN model is executed by a dedicated, compiled piece of code (i.e., a DNN binary). From the security standpoint, the ability to reverse engineer such binaries (i.e., recovering the original, high-level representation of the implemented DNN) enables several applications, such as stealing DNN models, gray/white-box adversarial machine learning attacks and defenses, and backdoor detection. While a few recent works proposed dedicated approaches to reverse engineer DNN binaries, these approaches are fundamentally limited in the type of DNN binaries they support.\nTo address these limitations, in this paper, we propose NEUROSCOPE, a novel data-driven approach based on dynamic analysis and machine learning to reverse engineer DNN binaries. This compiler-independent and code-feature-free approach enables NEUROSCOPE to support a larger variety of DNN binaries across different DNN compilers and hardware platforms, including binaries implementing DNN models using an interpreter-based approach. We demonstrate NEUROSCOPE's capability by using it to reverse engineer DNN binaries unsupported by previous approaches with high accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how NEUROSCOPE can reverse engineer a proprietary DNN binary compiled with a closed-source compiler and enable gray-box adversarial machine learning attacks."

    "abstract": "Influencer VPN ads (sponsored segments) on YouTube often disseminate misleading information about both VPNs, and security & privacy more broadly. However, it remains unclear how (or whether) these ads affect users' perceptions and knowledge about VPNs. In this work, we explore the relationship between YouTube VPN ad exposure and users' mental models of VPNs, security, and privacy. We use a novel VPN ad detection model to calculate the ad exposure of 217 participants via their YouTube watch histories, and we develop scales to characterize their mental models in relation to claims commonly made in VPN ads. Through (pre-registered) regression-based analysis, we find that exposure to VPN ads is significantly correlated with familiarity with VPN brands and increased belief in (hyperbolic) threats. While not specific to VPNs, these threats are often discussed in VPN ads. In contrast, although many participants agree with both factual and misleading mental models of VPNs that often appear in ads, we find no significant correlation between exposure to VPN ads and these mental models. These findings suggest that, if VPN ads do impact mental models, then it is predominantly emotional (i.e., threat perceptions) rather than technical."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/nam",
    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents unique challenges in programming due to the contrast between traditional and FHE language paradigms. A key challenge is selecting ciphertext configurations (CCs) to achieve the desired level of security, performance, and accuracy simultaneously. Finding the design point satisfying the goal is often labor-intensive (probably impossible), for which reason previous works settle down to a reasonable CC that brings acceptable performance. When FHE is applied to neural networks (NNs), we have observed that the distinct layered architecture of NN models opens the door for a performance improvement by using layer-wise CCs, because a globally chosen CC may not be the best possible CC for every layer individually. This paper introduces LOHEN, a technique crafted to attain high performance of NN inference by enabling to use layer-wise CC efficiently. Empowered with a cryptographic gadget that allows switching between arbitrary CCs, LOHEN allocates layer-wise CCs for individual layers tailored to their structural properties, while minimizing the increased overhead incurred by CC switching with its capability to replace costly FHE operations. LOHEN can also be engineered to attain higher accuracy, yet deliver higher performance compared to state-of-the-art studies, by additionally adopting the multi-scheme techniques in a layer-wise manner. Moreover, the developers using LOHEN are given the capability of customizing the selection policy to adjust the desired levels of performance and accuracy, subject to their demands. Our evaluation shows that LOHEN improves the NN inference performance in both of these cases when compared to the state-of-the-art. When used to improve the CKKS-only inference, LOHEN improves the NN inference performance of various NNs 1.08â2.88x. LOHEN also improves the performance of mixed-scheme NN inference by 1.34â1.75x without accuracy loss. These two results along with other empirical analyses, advocate that LOHEN can widely help improve the performance of NN inference over FHE."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable exciting LLM-integrated applications, which perform text-based tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model into deviating from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate prompts and user data.\nWe introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/StruQ."

    "abstract": "In recent years, major social media platforms have implemented increasingly strict moderation policies, resulting in bans and restrictions on conspiracy theory-related content. To circumvent these restrictions, conspiracy theorists are turning to alternatives, such as Telegram, where they can express and spread their views with fewer limitations. Telegram offers channelsâvirtual rooms where only administrators can broadcast messagesâand a more permissive content policy. These features have created the perfect breeding ground for a complex ecosystem of conspiracy channels.\nIn this paper, we illuminate this ecosystem. First, we propose an approach to detect conspiracy channels. Then, we discover that conspiracy channels can be clustered into four distinct communities comprising over 17,000 channels. Finally, we uncover the \"Conspiracy Money Machine,\" revealing how most conspiracy channels actively seek to profit from their subscribers. We find conspiracy theorists leverage e-commerce platforms to sell questionable products or lucratively promote them through affiliate links. Moreover, we observe that conspiracy channels use donation and crowdfunding platforms to raise funds for their campaigns. We determine that this business involves hundreds of thousands of donors and generates a turnover of almost $71 million."

    "abstract": "The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is the main mechanism to protect inter-domain routing with BGP from prefix hijacks. It has already been widely deployed by large providers and the adoption rate is getting to a critical point. Almost half of all the global prefixes are now covered by RPKI and measurements show that 27% of networks are already using RPKI to validate BGP announcements. Over the past 10 years, there has been much research effort in RPKI, analyzing different facets of the protocol, such as software vulnerabilities, robustness of the infrastructure or the proliferation of RPKI validation. In this work, we compile the first systemic overview of the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in RPKI and quantify the security landscape of the global RPKI deployments based on our measurements and analysis. Our study discovers that 56% of the global RPKI validators suffer from at least one documented vulnerability. We also do a systematization of knowledge for existing RPKI security research and complement the existing knowledge with novel measurements in which we discover new trends in availability of RPKI repositories, and their communication patterns with the RPKI validators. We weave together the results of existing research and our study, to provide a comprehensive tableau of vulnerabilities, their sources, and to derive future research paths necessary to prepare RPKI for full global deployment."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the prevalence and security impact of open tunnelling hosts on the Internet. These hosts accept legacy or modern tunnelling traffic from any source. We first scan the Internet for vulnerable IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, using 7 different scan methods, revealing more than 4 million vulnerable hosts which accept unauthenticated IP in IP (IPIP), Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), IPv4 in IPv6 (4in6), or IPv6 in IPv4 (6in4) traffic. These hosts can be abused as one-way proxies, can enable an adversary to spoof the source address of packets, or can permit access to an organization's private network. The discovered hosts also facilitate new Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Two new DoS attacks amplify traffic: one concentrates traffic in time, and another loops packets between vulnerable hosts, resulting in an amplification factor of at least 16 and 75, respectively. Additionally, we present an Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack, where the outgoing bandwidth of a host is drained. Finally, we discuss countermeasures and hope our findings will motivate people to better secure tunnelling hosts."

    "abstract": "Real-time Clock (RTC) has been widely used in various real-time systems to provide precise system time. In this paper, we reveal a new security vulnerability of the RTC circuit, where the internal storage time or timestamp can be arbitrarily modified forward or backward. The security threat of dynamic modifications of system time caused by this vulnerability is called TimeTravel. Based on acoustic resonance and piezoelectric effects, TimeTravel applies acoustic guide waves to the quartz crystal, thereby adjusting the characteristics of the oscillating signal transmitted into the RTC circuit. By manipulating the parameters of acoustic waves, TimeTravel can accelerate or decelerate the timing speed of system time at an adjustable rate, resulting in the relative drift of the timing, which can pose serious safety threats. To assess the severity of TimeTravel, we examine nine modules and two commercial devices under the RTC circuit. The experimental results show that TimeTravel can drift system time forward and backward at a chosen speed with a maximum 93% accuracy. Our analysis further shows that TimeTravel can maintain an attack success rate of no less than 77% under environments with typical obstacle items."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chang-yijia-verification",
    "abstract": "The great economic values of deep neural networks (DNNs) urge AI enterprises to protect their intellectual property (IP) for these models. Recently, proof-of-training (PoT) has been proposed as a promising solution to DNN IP protection, through which AI enterprises can utilize the record of DNN training process as their ownership proof. To prevent attackers from forging ownership proof, a secure PoT scheme should be able to distinguish honest training records from those forged by attackers. Although existing PoT schemes provide various distinction criteria, these criteria are based on intuitions or observations. The effectiveness of these criteria lacks clear and comprehensive analysis, resulting in existing schemes initially deemed secure being swiftly compromised by simple ideas. In this paper, we make the first move to identify distinction criteria in the style of formal methods, so that their effectiveness can be explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, we conduct systematic modeling to cover a wide range of attacks and then theoretically analyze the distinctions between honest and forged training records. The analysis results not only induce a universal distinction criterion, but also provide detailed reasoning to demonstrate its effectiveness in defending against attacks covered by our model. Guided by the criterion, we propose a generic PoT construction that can be instantiated into concrete schemes. This construction sheds light on the realization that trajectory matching algorithms, previously employed in data distillation, possess significant advantages in PoT construction. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can resist attacks that have compromised existing PoT schemes, which corroborates its superiority in security."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/xu",
    "abstract": "An air-gapped environment is widely regarded as a secure measure against the leakage of sensitive information, as it is physically isolated from insecure external networks. This paper presents a new covert-channel attack named DiskSpy, which reveals the risk of secretly sending sensitive information from air-gapped environments by modulating hard disk vibrations. In particular, DiskSpy leverages the vibrations of commonly used storage devices, hard disk drives (HDDs), in air-gapped computers to encode sensitive information. It then employs millimeter-wave (mmWave) to sense these vibrations and decode the underlying data. In practice, HDD vibrations are extremely weak and mmWave signals suffer significant power attenuation in long-distance propagation. To realize a practical attack at a long distance, we develop a novel mmWave-based long-range Âµm-level vibration sensing technique to push the limit of mmWave sensing. We implement DiskSpy with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radars and conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that even at a long attack range of 22m, DiskSpy can send secret information to a remote mmWave radar at 20bps with a BER lower than 1.2%. More importantly, DiskSpy has no restriction on the mounting manner and placement of the HDD, and can launch attacks even in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios."

    "abstract": "Cloud-based model training presents significant privacy challenges, as users must upload personal data for training high-performance models. Once uploaded, this data goes beyond the user's control and could be misused for other purposes. Users need tools to control the usage scope of the uploaded training data, preventing unauthorized training without compromising authorized training. Unfortunately, existing solutions overlook this issue.\nIn this paper, we propose and achieve a unique privacy-utility goal tailored for cloud-based model training, considering both user demand and legal requirements. Our approach provides task-level control of training data usage, simultaneously ensuring each protected data exhibits noticeable visual changes to address fundamental privacy concerns. We introduce carefully designed noise to each training data for privacy protection. These noises are designed to provide visual protection while minimizing the shifts in the feature domain through adversarial optimization. By adjusting the correlation between noise and class labels, we guide the model to learn the correct features for the target task while preventing unauthorized privacy task training. Additionally, we introduce the overflow matrix for compatibility with existing encoding and transmission frameworks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that it can simultaneously protect visual privacy (SSIM is 0.028) and prevent unauthorized model training (protection success rate achieved 100%), while the accuracy of the target task model is slightly reduced by about 1.8%."

    "abstract": "Localization is crucial for Autonomous Driving (AD), which serves as a critical foundation impacting the performance of downstream modules. While Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) techniques enhance localization accuracy and reliability, the security of fusion-based localization systems has emerged as a major concern. Although existing studies have extensively investigated security aspects of these systems, the impact of vehicle dynamics on the effectiveness of Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing attacks is persistently overlooked.\nBridging this research gap, we propose the Motion-Sensitive Analysis Framework (MSAF), which focuses on analyzing previously underestimated dynamic behaviors of vehicles. Our investigation demonstrates that two dynamic scenarios, acceleration and high-speed cruising, significantly influence the success rates of GPS spoofing attacks. These scenarios, commonly encountered across driving conditions, exhibit heightened vulnerabilities under MSAF analysis. Building on these insights, we design two dynamics-targeted attack strategies and evaluate them across three testbeds: our simulated framework (MSAF_MSF) and two real-world MSF-based autonomous driving systems (Apollo_MSF and Shenlan_MSF). The results demonstrate a significant attack efficiency improvement by our method: MSAF requires substantially less time to complete attacks compared to the baseline while achieving higher success rates.

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/kustosch",
    "abstract": "Medical devices become increasingly connected and thus require security measures to ensure patient safety and data protection. However, such connected medical devices are often reported to lack basic security and to run on unpatched and outdated software. Thus, there is an increasing push to deliver security patches faster and more regularly to devices in the field. In this work, we empirically study current practices of patching connected medical devices by conducting 23 semi-structured interviews with participants from nine healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) and three medical device manufacturers, also capturing data on actual updating practices for 25 specific medical devices. We find that delivering software updates to medical devices is an laborious and costly process for HDOs and manufacturers, as operational demands for medical use and an increasing need for infrastructure management put significant strain on involved stakeholders, thus rendering it questionable if conventional security patching will actually work in the healthcare sector without overwhelming it operationally and financially."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/weissberg",
    "abstract": "Video calls have become an essential part of remote work. They enable employees to collaborate from different locations, including their home. Transmitting video from the personal living environment, however, poses a privacy risk: Colleagues may gain insight into private information through details in the background. To limit this risk, video conferencing services implement virtual backgrounds that conceal the real environment during a video call. Unfortunately, this protection suffers from imperfections and pixels from the environment occasionally become visible. \nIn this paper, we investigate this privacy leak. We analyze the virtual background techniques used in two major video conferencing services (Zoom and Google) and determine how pixels of the environment leak. Based on this analysis, we propose a reconstruction attack: This attack removes the virtual background by re-purposing the video conferencing software and uses semantic segmentation to filter out the video caller. As a result, only pixels leaking from the environment remain and can be aggregated into a reconstructed image.\nWe examine the efficacy of this attack in a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. In comparison to previous studies, our attack recovers at least 53% more leaked pixels from a video call, exposing larger areas of the environment. We thus conclude that virtual backgrounds currently do not provide an adequate protection in practice."

    "abstract": "TEE implementations on RISC-V offer an enclave abstraction by introducing a trusted component called the security monitor (SM). The SM performs critical tasks such as isolating enclaves from each other as well as from the OS by using privileged ISA instructions that enforce the physical memory protection. However, the SM executes at the highest privilege layer on the platform (machine-mode) along side firmware that is not only large in size but also includes third-party vendor code specific to the platform. In this paper, we present Doramiâa privilege separation approach that isolates the SM from the firmware thus reducing the attack surface on TEEs. Dorami re-purposes existing ISA features to enforce its isolation and achieves its goals without large overheads."

    "abstract": "Preparing university students to build privacy-preserving systems requires preparing them to design around societal contexts and stakeholders. While legislation such as GDPR and CCPA provide regulatory frameworks for such design, discussions of privacy and stakeholder values can be fairly abstract for students. From an educational perspective, teaching abstract concepts such as the \"right to be forgotten\" in the concrete context of technical implementation can help students grapple with what these concepts mean in practice.\nThis paper proposes a framework for designing technical assignments that ask students to resolve tensions between conflicting stakeholders while implementing a specific technical feature. We describe a privacy-facing assignment for a second-year introductory computer systems course, and explore its efficacy. We find that students make different design choices and implement for different values based on the specific stakeholder conflict with which they work. We also find that the assignment design engages students in thinking about how abstract values affect technical design decisions in the context of privacy."

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, applications of neural networks have spread to every aspect of our lives. A large number of companies base their businesses on building products that use neural networks for tasks such as face recognition, machine translation, and self-driving cars. Much of the intellectual property underpinning these products is encoded in the exact parameters of the neural networks. Consequently, protecting these is of utmost priority to businesses. At the same time, many of these products need to operate under a strong threat model, in which the adversary has unfettered physical control of the product. In this work, we present BarraCUDA, a novel attack on general-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that can extract parameters of neural networks running on the popular Nvidia Jetson devices. BarraCUDA relies on the observation that the convolution operation, used during inference, must be computed as a sequence of partial sums, each leaking one or a few parameters. Using correlation electromagnetic analysis with these partial sums, BarraCUDA can recover parameters of real-world convolutional neural networks."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zou",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses."

    "abstract": "Many recent papers have proposed novel electrical measurements or physical inspection technologies for defending printed circuit boards (PCBs) and PCB assemblies (PCBAs) against tampering. As motivation, these papers frequently cite Bloomberg News' \"The Big Hack'', video game modchips, and \"interdiction attacks'' on IT equipment. We find this trend concerning for two reasons. First, implementation errors and security architecture are rarely discussed in recent PCBA security research, even though they were the root causes of these commonly-cited attacks and most other attacks that have occurred or been proposed by researchers. This suggests that the attacks may be poorly understood. Second, if we assume that novel countermeasures and validation methodologies are tailored to these oft-cited attacks, then significant recent work has focused on attacks that can already be mitigated instead of on open problems.\nWe write this SoK to address these concerns. We explain which tampering threats can be mitigated by a PCBA security architecture. Then, we enumerate assumptions that security architecture depends on. We compare and contrast assurances achieved by security architecture vs. by recently-proposed electrical or inspection-based tamper detection. Finally, we review over fifty PCBA attacks to show how most can be prevented by proper architecture and careful implementation."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/wilson",
    "abstract": "Detecting phishing, spam, fake accounts, data scraping, and other malicious activity in online social networks (OSNs) is a problem that has been studied for well over a decade, with a number of important results. Nearly all existing works on abuse detection have as their goal producing the best possible binary classifier; i.e., one that labels unseen examples as \"benign\" or \"malicious\" with high precision and recall. However, no prior published work considers what comes next: what does the service actually do after it detects abuse?\nIn this paper, we argue that detection as described in previous work is not the goal of those who are fighting OSN abuse. Rather, we believe the goal to be selecting actions (e.g., ban the user, block the request, show a CAPTCHA, or \"collect more evidence\") that optimize a tradeoff between harm caused by abuse and impact on benign users. With this framing, we see that enlarging the set of possible actions allows us to move the Pareto frontier in a way that is unattainable by simply tuning the threshold of a binary classifier.\nTo demonstrate the potential of our approach, we present Predictive Response Optimization (PRO), a system based on reinforcement learning that utilizes available contextual information to predict future abuse and user-experience metrics conditioned on each possible action, and select actions that optimize a multi-dimensional tradeoff between abuse/harm and impact on user experience.\nWe deployed versions of PRO targeted at stopping automated activity on Instagram and Facebook. In both cases our experiments showed that PRO outperforms a baseline classification system, reducing abuse volume by 59% and 4.5% (respectively) with no negative impact to users. We also present several case studies that demonstrate how PRO can quickly and automatically adapt to changes in business constraints, system behavior, and/or adversarial tactics."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/jing",
    "abstract": "In recent years, major privacy laws like the GDPR have brought about positive changes. However, challenges remain in enforcing the laws, particularly due to under-resourced regulators facing a large number of potential privacy-violating software applications (apps) and the high costs of investigating them. Since 2019, China has launched a series of privacy enforcement campaigns known as Special Privacy Rectification Campaigns (SPRCs) to address widespread privacy violations in its mobile application (app) ecosystem. Unlike the enforcement of the GDPR, SPRCs are characterized by large-scale privacy reviews and strict sanctions, under the strong control of central authorities. In SPRCs, central government authorities issue administrative orders to mobilize various resources for market-wide privacy reviews of mobile apps. They enforce strict sanctions by requiring privacy-violating apps to rectify issues within a short timeframe or face removal from app stores. While there are a few reports on SPRCs, the effectiveness and potential problems of this campaign-style privacy enforcement approach remain unclear to the community. In this study, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with app-related engineers involved in SPRCs to better understand the campaign-style privacy enforcement. Based on the interviews, we reported our findings on a variety of aspects of SPRCs, such as the processes that app engineers regularly follow to achieve privacy compliance in SPRCs, the challenges they encounter, the solutions they adopt to address these challenges, and the impacts of SPRCs, etc. We found that app engineers face a series of challenges in achieving privacy compliance in their apps. For example, they receive inconsistent app privacy review reports from multiple app stores and have difficulties confirming the issues flagged by these reports; they also lack institutional support for studying privacy laws, self-validating privacy compliance of their apps, communicating effectively between multiple stakeholders, and ensuring fairness in accountability when privacy non-compliance occurs. Furthermore, we found that while SPRCs have introduced several positive changes, there remain unaddressed concerns, such as the potential existence of circumvention techniques used to evade app privacy reviews."

    "abstract": "Uploading speech data to cloud servers poses privacy risks, making the protection of both acoustic and content privacy essential. Users often need the cloud to process non-sensitive information while protecting sensitive parts, with the ability to recover original data locally. However, achieving speech privacy protection that supports fine-grained customization and full recoverability remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on irreversible or inflexible techniques, such as uniformly anonymizing the entire speech or replacing sensitive texts, making them inadequate for this purpose. We introduce SpeechGuard, a system that enables recoverable and customizable speech privacy protection by applying reversible protection methods and assigning private information to permission groups. We design a multi-parameter warping function with an inverse function for voice conversion to protect acoustic privacy. We also develop a mechanism for automatic or manual detection and encryption of sensitive texts to protect content privacy. By categorizing listeners into permission groups and assigning warping parameters and encryption keys, SpeechGuard enables different listeners to recover varying levels of acoustic and content information according to their permissions, ensuring personalized access to speech data. Experiments on three datasets show that SpeechGuard outperforms three baseline systems in anonymity, sensitive content confidentiality, and attack resistance. Moreover, it provides recoverable and customizable protection for acoustic and content privacy, allowing for tailored privacy definitions and protection strength."

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.\nAt its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately $15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about $7 (0.004 ETH)."

    "abstract": "Multiple network management tasks, from resource allocation to intrusion detection, rely on some form of ML-based network traffic classification (MNC). Despite their potential, MNCs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, which can lead to outages, poor decision-making, and security violations, among other issues.\nThe goal of this paper is to help network operators assess and enhance the robustness of their MNC against adversarial inputs. The most critical step for this is generating inputs that can fool the MNC while being realizable under various threat models. Compared to other ML models, finding adversarial inputs against MNCs is more challenging due to the existence of non-differentiable components e.g., traffic engineering and the need to constrain inputs to preserve semantics and ensure reliability. These factors prevent the direct use of well-established gradient-based methods developed in adversarial ML (AML).\nTo address these challenges, we introduce PANTS, a practical white-box framework that uniquely integrates AML techniques with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to generate adversarial inputs for MNCs. We also embed PANTS into an iterative adversarial training process that enhances the robustness of MNCs against adversarial inputs. PANTS is 70% and 2x more likely in median to find adversarial inputs against target MNCs compared to state-of-the-art baselines, namely Amoeba and BAP. PANTS improves the robustness of the target MNCs by 52.7% (even against attackers outside of what is considered during robustification) without sacrificing their accuracy."

    "abstract": "Pose-driven human image animation has achieved tremendous progress, enabling the generation of vivid and realistic human videos from just one single photo. However, it conversely exacerbates the risk of image misuse, as attackers may use one available image to create videos involving politics, violence, and other illegal content. To counter this threat, we propose Dormant, a novel protection approach tailored to defend against pose-driven human image animation techniques. Dormant applies protective perturbation to one human image, preserving the visual similarity to the original but resulting in poor-quality video generation. The protective perturbation is optimized to induce misextraction of appearance features from the image and create incoherence among the generated video frames. Our extensive evaluation across 8 animation methods and 4 datasets demonstrates the superiority of Dormant over 6 baseline protection methods, leading to misaligned identities, visual distortions, noticeable artifacts, and inconsistent frames in the generated videos. Moreover, Dormant shows effectiveness on 6 real-world commercial services, even with fully black-box access."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/gong-xueluan",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs. In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, blackbox jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates, PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks.\nWe evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLON achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses. We will open-source our codes upon publication."

This paper makes two primary contributions:\nWe provide the first thorough analysis of a recently developed Any-out-of-N proof in the discrete logarithm (DLOG) setting and the associated RingCT scheme, introduced by ZGSX23 (S&P '23). The proof conceals the number of the secrets to offer greater anonymity than K-out-of-N proofs and uses an efficient \"K-Weight\" technique for its construction. However, we identify for the first time several limitations of using Any-out-of-N proofs, such as increased transaction sizes, heightened cryptographic complexities and potential security risks. These limitations prevent them from effectively mitigating the longstanding scalability bottleneck.\nWe then continue to explore the potential of using K-out-of-N proofs to enhance scalability of RingCT schemes. Our primary innovation is a new DLOG-based RingCT signature that integrates a refined \"K-Weight\"-based K-out-of-N proof and an entirely new tag proof. The latter is the first to efficiently enable the linkability of RingCT signatures derived from the former, effectively resisting double-spending attacks. \nFinally, we identify and patch a linkability flaw in ZGSX23's signature. We benchmark our scheme against this patched one to show that our scheme achieves a boost in scalability, marking a promising step forward."

A basic building block of LDP protocols is the frequency protocol, which estimates the frequency of each value in a specified domain. Although several frequency protocols have been proposed, all these protocols make compromises among the performances of accuracy, computation cost, and communication cost. In this paper, we introduce a precise and convenient equation to evaluate the accuracy of frequency protocols. We use it to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of existing protocols quantitatively. Based on the analysis, we address the shortcomings of these protocols and propose a new protocol, Random Wheel Spinner (RWS), which achieves optimal accuracy with low computation and communication costs simultaneously. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed protocols."

    "abstract": "PHP, a dominant scripting language in web development, powers a vast range of websites, from personal blogs to major platforms. While existing research primarily focuses on PHP application-level security issues like code injection, memory errors within the PHP interpreter have been largely overlooked. These memory errors, prevalent due to the PHP interpreter's extensive C codebase, pose significant risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHP servers. This paper introduces FlowFusion, the first automatic fuzzing framework to detect memory errors in the PHP interpreter. FlowFusion leverages dataflow as an efficient representation of test cases maintained by PHP developers, merging two or more test cases to produce fused test cases with more complex code semantics. Moreover, FlowFusion employs strategies such as test mutation, interface fuzzing, and environment crossover to increase bug finding. In our evaluation, FlowFusion found 158 unknown bugs in the PHP interpreter, with 125 fixed and 11 confirmed. Comparing FlowFusion against the official test suite and a naive test concatenation approach, FlowFusion can detect new bugs that these methods miss, while also achieving greater code coverage. FlowFusion also outperformed state-of-the-art fuzzers AFL++ and Polyglot, covering 24% more lines of code after 24 hours of fuzzing. FlowFusion has gained wide recognition among PHP developers and is now integrated into the official PHP toolchain."

    "abstract": "Modern computing systems are limited in performance by the memory bandwidth available to processors, a problem known as the memory wall. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) promises to substantially improve this problem by moving processing closer to the data, improving effective data bandwidth, and leading to superior performance on memory-intensive workloads. However, integrating PIM modules within a secure computing system raises an interesting challenge: unencrypted data has to move off-chip to the PIM, exposing the data to attackers and breaking assumptions on Trusted Computing Bases (TCBs). To tackle this challenge, this paper leverages multi-party computation (MPC) techniques, specifically arithmetic secret sharing and Yao's garbled circuits, to outsource bandwidth-intensive computation securely to PIM. Additionally, we leverage precomputation optimization to prevent the CPU's portion of the MPC from becoming a bottleneck. We evaluate our approach using the UPMEM PIM system over various applications such as Deep Learning Recommendation Model inference and Logistic Regression. Our evaluations demonstrate up to a 14.66x speedup compared to a secure CPU configuration while maintaining data confidentiality and integrity when outsourcing linear and/or nonlinear computation."

    "abstract": "A private-information-retrieval (PIR) scheme lets a client fetch a record from a remote database without revealing which record it fetched. Classic PIR schemes treat all database records the same but, in practice, some database records are much more popular (i.e., commonly fetched) than others. We introduce distributional PIR, a new type of PIR that can run faster than classic PIRâboth asymptotically and concretelyâwhen the popularity distribution is skewed. Distributional PIR provides exactly the same cryptographic privacy as classic PIR. The speedup comes from a relaxed form of correctness: distributional PIR guarantees that in-distribution queries succeed with good probability, while out-of-distribution queries succeed with lower probability. Because of its relaxed correctness, distributional PIR is best suited for applications where \"best-effort\" retrieval is acceptable. Moreover, for security, a client's decision to query the server must be independent of whether its past queries were successful.\nWe construct a distributional-PIR scheme that makes black-box use of classic PIR protocols, and prove a lower bound on the server runtime of a natural class of distributional-PIR schemes. On two real-world popularity distributions, our construction reduces compute costs by 5-77x compared to existing techniques. Finally, we build CrowdSurf, an end-to-end system for privately fetching tweets, and show that distributional-PIR reduces the end-to-end server cost by 8x."

Our research addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the users' technical background on ADT acceptability in an empirical study.\nOur Method Evaluation Model-based study consisted of n=102 participants (53 with a strong computer science background and 49 with a limited computer science background) who were asked to complete a series of ADT-related tasks. By analyzing their responses and comparing the results, we reveal that a very limited technical background is sufficient for ADT acceptability. This finding underscores attack trees' viability as a threat modeling method."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/ma-fuchen",
    "abstract": "Metadata consistency is crucial for distributed file systems (DFSes) as it ensures that different clients have a consistent view of the data. However, DFSes are inherently error-prone, leading to metadata inconsistencies. Though rare, such inconsistencies can have severe consequences, including data loss, service failures, and permission violations. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding of metadata inconsistency characteristics, let alone an effective method for detecting them.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive study of metadata inconsistencies over the past five years across four widely-used DFSes. We identified two key findings: 1) Metadata inconsistencies are mainly triggered by interrelated cross-node file operations rather than system faults. 2) The root cause of inconsistencies mainly lies in the metadata conflict resolution process. Inspired by these findings, we proposed Horcrux, a highly effective fuzzing framework for detecting metadata inconsistencies in DFSes. Horcrux uses cross-node operation modeling to reduce the infinite input combinations to a manageable space. In this way, Horcrux captures implicit cross-node operation relationships and triggers more conflict resolution logic. Currently, Horcrux has detected 10 previously unknown metadata inconsistencies. In addition, Horcrux covers 20.29%-146.21% more conflict resolution code than state-of-the-art tools."

    "abstract": "Network-wide DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) detection enables early attack detection and mitigates victim losses. However, unpredictable routing of DDoS traffic will invalidate the network administrator's prior knowledge of the network topology, causing existing sketch-based measurement systems to suffer from packet over-counting and processing stage mis-allocating issues. To address this gap, we propose Lemon, a routing-oblivious, resource-friendly, and scalable DDoS detection system that provides accurate detection of DDoS attacks without any assumption on the traffic routing. Specifically, we design a novel data structure (Lemon sketch) that supports over-counting-free and mis-allocating-free measurements in the data plane. Lemon control plane aggregates Lemon sketches from measurement points and leverages per-flow level network-wide measurement results for DDoS attack detection and victim identification. We implement Lemon in both software switch (Bmv2) and programmable switch hardware (Tofino). The evaluation results show that Lemon can achieve consistently high accuracy for DDoS detection in various topology and traffic distribution configurations."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/jiang-baoxiang",
    "abstract": "Past success in applying machine learning to data provenance graphs â a structured representation of the history of operating system activities â to detect host system intrusions has fueled continued interest in the security community. Recent solutions, particularly anomaly-based approaches using graph neural networks to detect previously unknown attacks, have reported near-perfect accuracy. Surprisingly, despite this high performance, the industry remains reluctant to adopt these intrusion detection systems (IDSs).\nWe identify Quality of Attribution (QoA) as the key factor contributing to this disconnect. QoA refers to the amount of effort required from a human analyst to investigate an IDS's detection output, uncover the root causes of an attack, understand its ramifications, and dismiss potential false alarms. Unfortunately, prior work often generates large volumes of low-QoA output, much of which is irrelevant to attack activities, leading to alert fatigue and analyst burnout.We introduce ORTHRUS, the first IDS to achieve high-QoA detection on data provenance graphs at the node level. ORTHRUS detects malicious hosts using a graph neural network (GNN) encoder designed to capture the fine-grained spatio-temporal dynamics of system events. It then reconstructs the attack path through dependency analysis to ensure high-QoA detection.\nWe compare ORTHRUS against five state-of-the-art IDSs. ORTHRUS reduces the number of nodes requiring manual inspection for attack attribution by several orders of magnitude, significantly easing the burden on security analysts while achieving strong detection performance."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of serverless computing in security-critical fields (e.g., finance and healthcare) motivates confidential serverless. This paper explores confidential virtual machines (CVMs), a promising hardware security feature offered by various CPU architectures, for securing serverless functions. However, our analysis reveals a mismatch between current CVM implementations and function needs, resulting in performance bottlenecks, resource inefficiency, and an expanded trusted computing base (TCB).\nWe present split container, a design that separates security and management to create confidential containers with a minimal TCB. Our observation is that real-world serverless functions often require a limited set of OS functionalities. Thus, our design deploys a function-oriented OS (microkernel + library OS) within the CVM for secure execution of multiple functions while reusing an untrusted commodity OS like Linux outside for container management. Based on the split container design, we have implemented CoFunc, a system prototype that works on both AMD SEV and Intel TDX. With FunctionBench and ServerlessBench, CoFunc demonstrates significant performance improvements (up to 60Ã on SEV and 215Ã on TDX) compared to the only known CVM-based confidential container (Kata-CVM with optimizations), while incurring <14% performance overhead on average compared to a state-of-the-art non-confidential container system (lean container)."

    "abstract": "Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is an essential technique for monitoring the runtime state of a virtual machine. VMI systems are widely used by major cloud providers as they enable a range of applications, such as malware detection. Unfortunately, existing VMI systems suffer from several shortcomings: they either compete with the introspected VMs for shared CPU resources or report poor performance. Further, they cannot introspect hypervisors or bare metal machines.\nWe propose BlueGuard, a system that leverages the physically isolated Data Processing Unit (DPU) commonly found on data center servers to efficiently run full system introspection by both host and guest introspection (HGI).\nBlueGuard facilitates the creation of hardware-accelerated HGI applications and frees the CPU while providing performance isolation. As a beneficial side effect, BlueGuard is capable of introspecting even bare metal servers that are usually out of scope for VMI systems. Furthermore, BlueGuard abstracts the DPU accelerators and provides kernel bypassing, non-blocking memory access, and user-level threading to achieve Âµs-scale introspection latency. Finally, we introduce delta introspection to accelerate the detection of state changes with BlueGuard and demonstrate the ability to isolate infected machines on a network layer.\nWe implement and extensively evaluate BlueGuard on an NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU. Our system achieves a 4.3x detection speedup compared to prior work and is capable of monitoring tens of VMs concurrently without hindering the host performance."

    "abstract": "As modern in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems become more advanced and feature-rich, their complexity increases, expanding the attack surface. Since IVI systems often support vehicle controls, attackers can exploit their vulnerabilities to gain control of the car, posing a dangerous threat to property and personal safety. In this paper, we systematically analyze the attack surface of the Android Automotive Operating System (AAOS). We identify risks across the vehicle control chain, from the human-machine interface through relevant apps and services to the in-vehicle network communication. To prevent these risks, we propose Harness, a lightweight framework that transparently protects vehicle control from untrusted AAOS. Harness defines a minimal protection domain encompassing trusted software with permissions to perform security-critical vehicle control. Leveraging the hypervisor's capabilities, Harness isolates this domain from AAOS and protects its interactions with the external environment, ensuring vehicle control operations align with user intent. We implement Harness, and our evaluation shows it achieves security guarantees with only modest performance overhead."

We conducted semi-structured observational interviews with 37 vulnerability discovery beginners attempting to exploit 51 vulnerable programs. We capture the questions beginners have when trying to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, how they search for answers, and the challenges they face applying their searches' results. We performed a rigorous qualitative coding of our dataset of 3950 events characterizing participants' actions to identify several behaviors and obstacles faced, along with quantitative measures to determine their most frequent issues.\nWe found beginners struggle to understand how to exploit vulnerabilities, craft their solutions, and even complete common technical tasks. They were often unable to find relevant information online to overcome these struggles, as they lacked the relevant vocabulary to craft effective keyword searches. When they did find relevant web pages, they struggled to properly transfer information from the web to their challenges due to misunderstandings and missing context. Based on our results, we offer suggestions for vulnerability discovery educators and resource creators to produce higher-quality materials to help facilitate beginner learning."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/nazaraliyev",
    "abstract": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become a critical part of computing systems at all scales. In this paper, we demonstrate new side channel attacks targeting the Graphics DDR (GDDR) memory chips. While several studies have demonstrated attacks on CPU memory chips, revealing potential security vulnerabilities, these attacks do not easily transfer to GPU memories, due to differences in the microarchitecture and operational characteristics of GDDR memory and GPU memory controllers, as well as the distinct computational model of GPUs. We reverse-engineer the mapping of physical addresses to GDDR physical bank addresses and show that existing row buffer timing attacks on these systems are ineffective due to row buffer management policies. Instead, our attacks target the Refresh Management (RFM) feature engineered into modern memories to mitigate Rowhammer vulnerabilities. We identify RFM-based timing leakage where repeated accesses to the same bank trigger refresh events, leading to measurable differences in access times. We exploit this leakage to first construct covert channel attacks on a shared GPU, achieving a bandwidth of over 50 KBps per bank with a low error rate of 0.03%. We demonstrate two end-to-end side-channel attacks on discrete GPUs with GDDR6: application fingerprinting and 3D object rendering fingerprinting within Blender, achieving F1 scores of up to 95% and 98%, respectively. Additionally, we implement three side-channel attacks on GPU-based SoCs using LPDDR5 memory: application fingerprinting, web fingerprinting, and video fingerprinting, achieving high F1 scores. Finally, we present a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where the attacker leverages the RFM blocking to slow down applications by over 4.8Ã on average."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chang-yijia-encryption",
    "abstract": "Threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE) enables multiple parties to compute functions over their sensitive data without leaking data privacy. Most of existing ThFHE schemes are restricted to full threshold and require the participation of all parties to output computing results. Compared with these full-threshold schemes, arbitrary threshold (ATh)-FHE schemes are robust to non-participants and can be a promising solution to many real-world applications. However, existing AThFHE schemes are either inefficient to be applied with a large number of parties and a large data size, or insufficient to tolerate all types of non-participants. In this paper, we propose an AThFHE scheme to handle all types of non-participants with lower complexity over existing schemes. At the core of our scheme is the reduction from AThFHE construction to the design of a new primitive called approximate secret sharing (ApproxSS). Particularly, we formulate ApproxSS and prove the correctness and security of AThFHE on top of arbitrary-threshold (ATh)-ApproxSS's properties. Such a reduction reveals that existing AThFHE schemes implicitly design ATh-ApproxSS following a similar idea called \"noisy share\". Nonetheless, their ATh-ApproxSS design has high complexity and become the performance bottleneck. By developing ATASSES, an ATh-ApproxSS scheme based on a novel \"encrypted share'' idea, we reduce the computation (resp. communication) complexity from O(N^2K) to O(N^2+K) (resp. from O(NK) to O(N+K)). We not only theoretically prove the (approximate) correctness and security of ATASSES, but also empirically evaluate its efficiency against existing baselines. Particularly, when applying to a system with one thousand parties, ATASSES achieves a speedup of 3.83x â 15.4x over baselines."

HDHunter can discover discrepancies in not only HTTP requests but also HTTP responses and CGI responses. We evaluated our HDHunter prototype against 19 state-of-the-art HTTP implementations and identified 17 new HTTP Desync vulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "Recently, reproducibility has become a cornerstone in the security and privacy research community, including artifact evaluations and even a new symposium topic. However, Web measurements lack tools that can be reused across many measurement tasks without modification, while being robust to circumvention, and accurate across the wide range of behaviors in the Web. As a result, most measurement studies use custom tools and varied archival formats, each of unknown correctness and significant limitations, systematically affecting the research's accuracy and reproducibility.\nTo address these limitations, we present WebREC, a Web measurement tool that is, compared against the current state-of-the-art, accurate (i.e., correctly measures and attributes events not possible with existing tools), general (i.e., reusable without modification for a broad range of measurement tasks), and comprehensive (i.e., handling events from all relevant browser behaviors). We also present .web, an archival format for the accurate and reproducible measurement of a wide range of website behaviors. We empirically evaluate WebREC's accuracy by replicating well-known Web measurement studies and showing that WebREC's results more accurately match our baseline. We then assess if WebREC and .web succeed as general-purpose tools, which could be used to accomplish many Web measurement tasks without modification. We find that this is so: 70% of papers discussed in a 2024 web crawling SoK paper could be conducted using WebREC as is, and a larger number (48%) could be leveraged against .web archives without requiring any new crawling."

    "abstract": "Sanitizers for spatial and temporal memory errors have become a cornerstone of security testing. Popular redzone-based sanitizers such as AddressSanitizer (ASan) offer high compatibility and effectiveness through the use of redzones, but incur significant runtime overhead. A major cause of this overhead is the traditional use of per-object redzone metadata, which constrains the sanitizer to check individual addresses rather than entire ranges of memory at onceâas is done by classic bounds checkers based on per-pointer metadata.\nIn this paper, we introduce RangeSanitizer (RSan), a redzone-based sanitizer that introduces a novel metadata and check paradigm. RSan combines the compatibility of redzones with a rich per-object metadata format that allows for range (rather than address) checks and powerful optimizations. RSan stores bounds information inside the underflow redzone associated with each memory object. By combining pointer tagging with power-of-two size classes, RSan can swiftly locate metadata and validate an access to an arbitrary memory range with a single check. RSan incurs a geomean runtime overhead of 44% on SPEC CPU2017, faster than all state-of-the-art redzone-based sanitizers and twice as fast as ASan. Additionally, fuzzing with AFL++ and RSan as sanitizer improves state-of-the-art throughput by up to 70%."

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables operations on encrypted data, making it extremely useful for privacy-preserving applications, especially in cloud computing environments. In such contexts, operations like ranking, order statistics, and sorting are fundamental functionalities often required for database queries or as building blocks of larger protocols. However, the high computational overhead and limited native operations of FHE pose significant challenges for an efficient implementation of these tasks. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that all these functionalities are based on comparing elements, which is a severely expensive operation under encryption.\nPrevious solutions have typically based their designs on swap-based techniques, where two elements are conditionally swapped based on the results of their comparison. These methods aim to reduce the primary computational bottleneck: the comparison depth, which is the number of non-parallelizable homomorphic comparisons in the algorithm. The current state of the art solutions for sorting by Lu et al. (IEEE S&P '21) and Hong et al. (IEEE TIFS 2021), for instance, achieve a comparison depth of log^2 N and k logk^2N, respectively.\nIn this paper, we address the challenge of reducing the comparison depth by shifting away from the swap-based paradigm. We present solutions for ranking, order statistics, and sorting, that achieve a comparison depth of up to 2 (constant), making our approach highly parallelizable and suitable for hardware acceleration. Leveraging the SIMD capabilities of the CKKS FHE scheme, our approach re-encodes the input vector under encryption to allow for simultaneous comparisons of all elements with each other. The homomorphic re-encoding incurs a minimal computational overhead of O(log N) rotations. Experimental results show that our approach ranks a 128-element vector in approximately 5.76s, computes its argmin/argmax in 12.83s, and sorts it in 78.64s."

However, traditional auditing systems often generate inaccurate and incomplete provenance graphs, or fail to work due to operational restrictions in AR/VR devices. This paper presents REALITYCHECK, a provenance-based auditing system designed to support accurate root cause analysis and impact assessments of complex AR/VR attacks. Our system first enhances the W3C PROV data model with additional ontology to capture AR/VR-specific entities and causal relationships. Then, we employ a novel adaptation of natural language processing and feature-based log correlation techniques to transparently extract entities and relationships from dispersed, unstructured AR/VR logs into provenance graphs. Finally, we introduce an AR/VR-aware execution partitioning technique to filter out forensically irrelevant data and false causal relationships from these provenance graphs, improving analysis accuracy and investigation speed. We built a REALITYCHECK prototype for Meta Quest 2 and evaluated it against 25 real-world AR/VR attacks. The results show that REALITYCHECK generates accurate provenance graphs for all AR/VR attacks and incurs low runtime overhead across benchmarked applications. Notably, our execution partitioning approach drastically reduces the size of the graph without sacrificing essential investigation details. Our system operates non-intrusively, requires no additional installation, and is generalizable across various AR/VR devices."

In this paper, we use the Borden-Kopp model of deception to develop a comprehensive ontology of MR deception attacks. Further, we derive two models to assess impact of MR deception attacks on information communication and decision-making. The first, an information-theoretic model, mathematically formalizes the effects of attacks on information communication. The second, a decision-making model, details the effects of attacks on interlaced cognitive processes. Using our ontology and models, we establish the MR Deception Analysis Framework (DAF) to assess the effects of MR deception attacks on information channels, perception, and attention. Our SoK uncovers five key findings for research and practice and identifies five research gaps to guide future work."

    "abstract": "Super-apps have emerged as comprehensive platforms integrating various mini-apps to provide diverse services. While super-apps offer convenience and enriched functionality, they can introduce new privacy risks. This paper reveals a new privacy leakage source in super-apps: mini-app interaction history, including mini-app usage history (Mini-H) and operation history (Op-H). Mini-H refers to the history of mini-apps accessed by users, such as their frequency and categories. Op-H captures user interactions within mini-apps, including button clicks, bar drags, and image views. Super-apps can naturally collect these data without instrumentation due to the web-based feature of mini-apps. We identify these data types as novel and unexplored privacy risks through a literature review of 30 papers and an empirical analysis of 31 super-apps. We design a mini-app interaction history-oriented inference attack (THEFT), to exploit this new vulnerability. Using THEFT, the insider threats within the low-privilege business department of the super-app vendor acting as the adversary can achieve more than 95.5% accuracy in inferring privacy attributes of over 16.1% of users. THEFT only requires a small training dataset of 200 users from public breached databases on the Internet. We also engage with super-app vendors and a standards association to increase industry awareness and commitment to protect this data. Our contributions are significant in identifying overlooked privacy risks, demonstrating the effectiveness of a new attack, and influencing industry practices toward better privacy protection in the super-app ecosystem."

    "abstract": "While searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) offers efficient, sublinear search over encrypted data, it remains susceptible to leakage abuse attacks (LAAs), which can exploit access and search patterns to compromise data privacy. Existing methods for quantifying leakage typically require a comprehensive analysis of all queries, making them unsuitable for real-time risk assessment. Since leakages in SSE are revealed incrementally with each query, there is a pressing need for risk assessments to be conducted on the fly, enabling prompt alerts to clients about potential privacy threats. To address this challenge, we propose ALERT, a machine learning-enhanced framework for real-time risk assessment in searchable encryption. ALERT leverages sophisticated learning algorithms to automatically identify keyword features from public auxiliary information, learning them as a classifier. When a query is executed, ALERT efficiently predicts the associated keyword and estimates the likelihood of leakage. Experimental results show that ALERT can deliver predictions within seconds, achieving a substantial speed-up of 31.1x compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

However, this technology also introduces significant security challenges. Previous research highlighted the security implications of G-Codesâcommands used to control the printing process. These studies assumed powerful attackers and focused on manipulations of the printed models, leaving gaps in understanding the full attack potential.\nIn this study, we systematically analyze security threats associated with 3D printing, focusing specifically on vulnerabilities caused by G-Code commands. We introduce attacks and attacker models that assume a less powerful adversary than traditionally considered, broadening the scope of potential security threats. Our findings show that even minimal access to the 3D printer can result in significant security breaches, such as unauthorized access to subsequent print jobs or persistent misconfiguration of the printer. We identify 278 potentially malicious G-Codes across the attack categories Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Model Manipulation. Our evaluation demonstrates the applicability of these attacks across various 3D printers and their firmware. Our findings underscore the need for a better standardization process of G-Codes and corresponding security best practices."

In this paper, we take on the problem of protecting compartmentalized software from hardware cache side-channel attacks. We consider unique challenges that compartmentalized software poses in terms of securing caches, which include performance implications, efficient and secure data sharing, and avoiding leakage when shared libraries are called by multiple callers. We propose SCC - a framework that addresses these challenges by 1) multi-level cache partitioning including L1 caches with a series of optimizations to avoid performance impact; 2) the concept of domain-oriented partitioning where cache partitions are created per memory domain, instead of per compartment; and 3) creating separate partition instance of a shared library code for each caller. We formally prove the security of SCC using operational semantics and evaluate its performance using the gem5 simulator on a set of compartmentalized benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Many software products are composed of components integrated from other teams or external parties. Each additional link in a software product's supply chain increases the risk of the injection of malicious behavior. To improve supply chain provenance, many cybersecurity frameworks, standards, and regulations recommend the use of software signing. However, recent surveys and measurement studies have found that the adoption rate and quality of software signatures are low. We lack in-depth industry perspectives on the challenges and practices of software signing. \nTo understand software signing in practice, we interviewed 18 experienced security practitioners across 13 organizations. We study the challenges that affect the effective implementation of software signing in practice. We also provide possible impacts of experienced software supply chain failures, security standards, and regulations on software signing adoption. To summarize our findings: (1) We present a refined model of the software supply chain factory model highlighting practitioner's signing practices; (2) We highlight the different challengesâtechnical, organizational, and humanâthat hamper software signing implementation; (3) We report that experts disagree on the importance of signing; and (4) We describe how internal and external events affect the adoption of software signing. Our work describes the considerations for adopting software signing as one aspect of the broader goal of improved software supply chain security."

    "abstract": "Steganography embeds confidential data within seemingly innocuous communications. Provable security in steganography, a long-sought goal, has become feasible with deep generative models. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between security and efficiency. This paper introduces SparSamp, an efficient provably secure steganography method based on sparse sampling. SparSamp embeds messages by combining them with pseudo-random numbers to obtain message-derived random numbers for sampling. It enhances extraction accuracy and embedding capacity by increasing the sampling intervals and making the sampling process sparse. SparSamp preserves the original probability distribution of the generative model, thus ensuring security. It introduces only $O(1)$ additional complexity per sampling step, enabling the fastest embedding speed without compromising generation speed. SparSamp is designed to be plug-and-play; message embedding can be achieved by simply replacing the sampling component of an existing generative model with SparSamp. We implemented SparSamp in text, image, and audio generation models. It can achieve embedding speeds of up to 755 bits/second with GPT-2, 5046 bits/second with DDPM, and 9,223 bits/second with WaveRNN."

    "abstract": "Intel SGX's vision of secure enclaved execution has been plagued by a continuous line of side channels. Among these, the ability to track enclave page accesses emerged as a particularly versatile and indispensable attack primitive. Despite nearly a decade since the original controlled-channel attack, existing mitigations remain focused on detection rather than prevention or depend on impractical developer annotations and hypothetical hardware extensions. This paper introduces TLBlur, a novel approach that leverages the recent AEX-Notify hardware extension in modern Intel SGX processors to essentially limit the bandwidth of controlled-channel attacks to the anonymity set of recently used pages.\nOur defense leverages the fact that page translations served from the processor's Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), which is forcibly flushed during enclave interruptions, remain oblivious to adversaries. We introduce practical compile-time instrumentation to seamlessly log page accesses within the protected enclave application. Additionally, we utilize AEX-Notify to implement a custom enclave interrupt handler that hides the N most recently accessed application pages by transparently prefetching them into the hardware TLB. Our evaluation on real-world libraries such as libjpeg, yescrypt, wolfSSL, and OpenSSL yields acceptable performance overheads, improving over prior work with several orders of magnitude."

However, they also appear in instant-messaging social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. In these platforms, information-based attacks primarily happen in groups and channels, requiring manual moderation efforts by channel administrators. We collect, label, and analyze a large dataset of more than 17 million Telegram comments and messages. Our analysis uncovers two independent, coordinated networks that spread pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian propaganda, garnering replies from real users. We propose a novel mechanism for detecting propaganda that capitalizes on the relationship between legitimate user messages and propaganda replies and is tailored to the information that Telegram makes available to moderators. Our method is faster, cheaper, and has a detection rate (97.6%) 11.6 percentage points higher than human moderators after seeing only one message from an account. It remains effective despite evolving propaganda."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/bailluet",
    "abstract": "Automating gadget chaining is a challenge that has attracted significant attention since the introduction of code-reuse attacks. Influenced by the primitives offered by stack-overflow vulnerabilities, several approaches were proposed that required the attacker to control the stack. Since then, most proposed approaches have had strong requirements on the capabilities of the attacker. However, during the last decade, a plethora of new attack primitives have emerged â e.g. use-after-free, heap-overflow â often breaking the requirements of existing approaches â e.g. controlling the stack. This paper presents a new approach to synthesizing code-reuse gadget chains that supports arbitrary exploitation primitives and layouts. We thoroughly compare the performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. We show its ability to outperform its competitors by supporting intricate exploitation primitives and layouts that other approaches cannot. Especially, we demonstrate its real-world applicability by synthesizing gadget chains for ten real-world vulnerabilities with diverse exploitation primitives that competing tools struggle with. Among them is our case study: CVE-2022-46152 â which targets a widely used trusted execution environment."

    "abstract": "Android apps can freely intermix native and web content using Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities. This blurring of the boundary between native and web, however, opens the door to HyTrack, a novel tracking technique. Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities have access to the default browser state to enable, e.g., seamless reuse of authentication tokens. HyTrack abuses this shared browser state to track users both in-app and across the web using the same identifier. We present several ways to hide or completely disguise the tracking from the user by integrating it into the app's UI. Depending on the used Android flavor, HyTrack leaves no visible traces at all. Furthermore, by combining basic functionalities of the Android operating system, we also show that identifiers created with HyTrack are almost impossible to get rid of. HyTrack can resurrect tracking identifiers even when users try last-resort techniques, such as changing the default browser or switching devices, making it more persistent than even evercookies were on the Web. While we do not find direct evidence that our technique is already employed, our findings indicate that all essential components are currently in place. A rapid deployment can occur at any given moment. To summarize, this paper provides an early warning of a potentially severe new tracking approach for the Android operating system that solely utilizes the intended behavior of commonly utilized Android features."

    "abstract": "Function names can greatly aid human reverse engineers, which has spurred the development of machine learning-based approaches to predicting function names in stripped binaries. Much current work in this area now uses transformers, applying a metaphor of machine translation from code to function names. Still, function naming models face challenges in generalizing to projects unrelated to the training set. In this paper, we take a completely new approach by transferring advances in automated image captioning to the domain of binary reverse engineering, such that different parts of a binary function can be associated with parts of its name. We propose BLens, which combines multiple binary function embeddings into a new ensemble representation, aligns it with the name representation latent space via a contrastive learning approach, and generates function names with a transformer architecture tailored for function names. Our experiments demonstrate that BLens significantly outperforms the state of the art. In the usual setting of splitting per binary, we achieve an F1 score of 0.79 compared to 0.70. In the cross-project setting, which emphasizes generalizability, we achieve an F1 score of 0.46 compared to 0.29. Finally, in an experimental setting reducing shared components across projects, we achieve an F1 score of 0.32 compared to 0.19."

    "abstract": "The pervasive adoption of Android as the leading operating system, due to its open-source nature, has simultaneously rendered it a prime target for malicious software attacks. In response, various learning-based Android malware detectors (AMDs) have been developed, achieving notable success in malware identification. However, these detectors are increasingly compromised by adversarial examples (AEs), which are subtly modified inputs designed to evade detection while maintaining malicious functionality. Recently, advanced adversarial example generation tools have been introduced that can reduce the efficacy of popular detectors to 1%. In this background, to address the critical need for more resilient AMDs, we propose a novel defense mechanism, Harnessing Attack Generativity for Defense Enhancement, i.e., HagDe. HagDe involves applying iterative perturbations in the direction of gradient ascent to all samples, aiming to exploit the high sensitivity of AEs to perturbations. This method enables the detection of adversarial samples by observing the disproportionate increase in the loss function following minor perturbations, distinguishing them from regular samples. To evaluate HagDe, we conduct an extensive evaluation on 15,000 samples and 15 different attack combinations. The experimental results show that ourtool can achieve a defense effectiveness of 88.5% on AdvDroidZero and 90.7% on BagAmmo, representing an increase of 32.45% and 11.28%, respectively, compared to the latest defense method KD_BU and LID."

    "abstract": "Semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) enhances the efficiency of privacy-preserving collaborative learning across clients with diverse processing capabilities. It updates the global model by aggregating local models from only partial fast clients without waiting for all clients to synchronize. We realize that such semi-asynchronous aggregation may expose the system to serious poisoning risks, even when defenses are in place, since it introduces considerable inconsistency among local models, giving chances for attackers to inject inconspicuous malicious ones. However, such risks remain largely underexplored. To plug this gap and fully explore the vulnerability of SAFL, in this paper, we propose a scalable stealth poisoning attack framework for Byzantine-resilient SAFL, called PoiSAFL. It can effectively impair SAFL's learning performance while bypassing three typical kinds of Byzantine-resilient defenses by strategically controlling malicious clients to upload undetectable malicious local models. The challenge lies in crafting malicious models that evade detection yet remain destructive. We construct a constrained optimization problem and propose three modules to approximate the optimization objective: the anti-training-based model initialization, loss-aware model distillation, and distance-aware model scaling. These modules initialize and refine malicious models with desired poisoning ability while keeping their performance, prediction entropy, and dissimilarity within benign ranges to bypass detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoiSAFL can defeat three typical categories of defenses. Besides, PoiSAFL can further amplify its attack impact by flexibly executing three proposed modules. Note that PoiSAFL is scalable and can incorporate new modules to defeat future new types of defenses."

Rigorous secure design practices, such as threat modeling (TM), can help identify threats and determine and prioritize mitigations early in the development lifecycle. However, there is limited evidence regarding how OSS developers consider threats and mitigations and whether they use established TM methods.\nOur research is the first to fill this gap by investigating OSS developers' TM practices and experiences. Using semi-structured interviews with 25 OSS developers, we explore participants' threat finding and mitigation practices, their challenges and reasons for adopting their practices, as well as desired support for implementing TM in their open-source projects. Because OSS development is often a volunteer effort, decentralized, and lacking security expertise, more structured TM methods introduce additional costs and are perceived as having limited benefit. Instead, we find almost all OSS developers conduct TM practices in an ad hoc manner due to the ease-of-use, flexibility, and low overhead of this approach. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for the OSS community to better support TM processes in OSS."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zhang-shenyi",
    "abstract": "Despite the implementation of safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which undermine these safety guardrails and pose significant security threats. Some defenses have been proposed to detect or mitigate jailbreaks, but they are unable to withstand the test of time due to an insufficient understanding of jailbreak mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural networks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden representations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts as toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that manipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through concept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic concepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts. However, unlike harmful prompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM output from rejection to compliance. Building on our analysis, we propose a comprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key components: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M. JBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input activates both toxic and jailbreak concepts. When a jailbreak prompt is detected, JBShield-M adjusts the hidden representations of the target LLM by enhancing the toxic concept and weakening the jailbreak concept, ensuring LLMs produce safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of JBShield, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.95 and reducing the average attack success rate of various jailbreak attacks to 2% from 61% across distinct LLMs."

    "abstract": "Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks present significant challenges for Tor onion services, where strict anonymity requirements render conventional mitigation strategies inapplicable. In response, the Tor community has recently revived the client puzzle idea in an official update to address real-world DoS attacks, leading to its adoption by several major onion services. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in the current puzzle system in Tor through a novel family of attacks, dubbed OnionFlation. The proposed attacks artificially inflate the required puzzle difficulty for all clients without causing noticeable congestion at the targeted service, rendering any existing onion service largely unusable at an attack cost of a couple of dollars per hour. Our ethical evaluation on the live Tor network demonstrates the impact of these attacks, which we have reported to the Tor Project and received acknowledgment. Our analysis reveals an undesirable trade-off in the client puzzle mechanism, which is the root cause of the discovered vulnerability, that forces the Tor onion system to choose between inflation resistance and congestion resistance, but not both. We offer practical guidance for Tor onion services aimed at balancing the mitigation of these attacks."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/maar",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the Linux kernel has seen a significant number of memory-safety vulnerabilities. However, exploiting these vulnerabilities becomes substantially harder as defenses increase. A fundamental defense of the Linux kernel is the randomization of memory locations for security-critical objects, which greatly limits or prevents exploitation.\nIn this paper, we show that we can exploit side-channel leakage in defenses to leak the locations of security-critical kernel objects. These location disclosure attacks enable successful exploitations on the latest Linux kernel, facilitating reliable and stable system compromise both with re-enabled and new exploit techniques. To identify side-channel leakages of defenses, we systematically analyze 127 defenses. Based on this analysis, we show that enabling any of 3 defenses â enforcing strict memory permissions or virtualizing the kernel heap or kernel stack â allows us to obtain fine-grained TLB contention patterns via an Evict+Reload TLB side-channel attack. We combine these patterns with kernel allocator massaging to present location disclosure attacks, leaking the locations of kernel objects, i.e., heap objects, page tables, and stacks. To demonstrate the practicality of these attacks, we evaluate them on recent Intel CPUs and multiple kernel versions, with a runtime of 0.3 s to 17.8 s and almost no false positives. Since these attacks work due to side-channel leakage in defenses, we argue that the virtual stack defense makes the system less secure."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/yan-yihui",
    "abstract": "The security of fingerprint authentication is increasingly at risk from various attacks. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a widely adopted approach to mitigate unauthorized access caused by compromised credentials. However, existing 2FA methods are not well-suited for direct use with fingerprint authentication devices, as they often require distinct and additional user interactions that disrupt established user habits, or they depend on specialized I/O interfaces that are not available on these devices. In this paper, we propose a novel 2FA scheme termed OneTouch, which maintains the simplicity of conventional fingerprint authentication - merely touching the scanner with a finger - while integrating a secondary challenge-response OTP (One-Time Password) authentication scheme using a wearable OTP token. This is accomplished by transforming the fingerprint scanner from a device designed for imaging fingerprints to an I/O device capable of capturing temporal voltage variations of the contact object. Consequently, OneTouch is capable of establishing touch-based communication channels between the scanner and the wearable token for OTP protocol exchange. By directly wiring the OTP token to the authentication device through human body, OneTouch minimizes the risk of interception by adversaries, thereby reducing the attack surface. We provide an extensive discussion of the security risks and evaluate the effectiveness of the touch-based channel for OTP credential exchange."

    "abstract": "Transient execution vulnerabilities have affected CPUs for the better part of the decade, yet, we are still missing methods to efficiently uncover them at the design stage. Existing approaches try to find programs that leak explicitly defined secrets, sometimes including the transmission over a sidechannel, which severely restricts the space of programs that can trigger detection. As a result, current fuzzers are forced to constrain the search space using templates of known vulnerabilities, which risks overfitting. What is missing is a general detection mechanism that (1) makes it easy for the fuzzer to trigger a violation and (2) catches vulnerabilities at their root cause â similarly to sanitizers in software. In this paper, we propose Phantom Trails, an efficient yet generic method for discovering transient execution vulnerabilities. Phantom Trails relies on a fuzzer-friendly detection model that can be applied without the need for templating. Ourndetector builds on two key design choices. First, it concentrates on finding microarchitectural data leaks independently of the covert channel, thereby focusing on the core of the attack. Second, it automatically infers all secret locations from the architectural behavior of a program, making it easier for the detector to find leaks. We evaluate Phantom Trails by fuzzing the BOOM RISC-V CPU, where it finds all known speculative vulnerabilities in 24-hours, starting from an empty seed and without pre-defined templates, as well as a new Spectre variant specific to BOOM â Spectre-LoopPredictor."

    "abstract": "On-device deep learning (DL) has rapidly gained adoption in mobile apps, offering the benefits of offline model inference and user privacy preservation over cloud-based approaches. However, it inevitably stores models on user devices, introducing new vulnerabilities, particularly model-stealing attacks and intellectual property infringement. While system-level protections like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a robust solution, practical challenges remain in achieving scalable on-device DL model protection, including complexities in supporting third-party models and limited adoption in current mobile solutions. Advancements in TEE-enabled hardware, such as NVIDIA's GPU-based TEEs, may address these obstacles in the future. Currently, watermarking serves as a common defense against model theft but also faces challenges here as many mobile app developers lack corresponding machine learning expertise and the inherent read-only and inference-only nature of on-device DL models prevents third parties like app stores from implementing existing watermarking techniques in post-deployment models.\nTo protect the intellectual property of on-device DL models, in this paper, we propose THEMIS, an automatic tool that lifts the read-only restriction of on-device DL models by reconstructing their writable counterparts and leverages the untrainable nature of on-device DL models to solve watermark parameters and protect the model owner's intellectual property. Extensive experimental results across various datasets and model structures show the superiority of THEMIS in terms of different metrics. Further, an empirical investigation of 403 real-world DL mobile apps from Google Play is performed with a success rate of 81.14%, showing the practicality of THEMIS."

    "abstract": "In data-driven applications, preserving user privacy while enabling valuable computations remains a critical challenge. Technologies like differential privacy have been pivotal in addressing these concerns. The shuffle model of DP requires no trusted curators and can achieve high utility by leveraging the privacy amplification effect yielded from shuffling. These benefits have led to significant interest in the shuffle model. However, the computation tasks in the shuffle model are limited to statistical estimation, making it inapplicable to real-world scenarios in which each user requires a personalized output. This paper introduces a novel paradigm termed Private Individual Computation (PIC), expanding the shuffle model to support a broader range of permutation-equivariant computations. PIC enables personalized outputs while preserving privacy, and enjoys privacy amplification through shuffling. We propose a concrete protocol that realizes PIC. By using one-time public keys, our protocol enables users to receive their outputs without compromising anonymity, which is essential for privacy amplification. Additionally, we present an optimal randomizer, the Minkowski Response, designed for the PIC model to enhance utility. We formally prove the security and privacy properties of the PIC protocol. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate PIC's capability in handling non-statistical computation tasks, and the efficacy of PIC and the Minkowski randomizer in achieving superior utility compared to existing solutions."

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have improved significantly in recent years to the point where generated fake images or audio are now indistinguishable from genuine media. As a result, humans are unable to differentiate between real and deepfake content. While this presents a huge benefit to the creative sector, its exploitation to fool the general public has resulted in a real-world threat to society. To prevent generative models from being exploited by adversaries, researchers have devoted much effort towards developing methods for differentiating between real and generated data. To date, most existing techniques are designed to reactively detect artifacts introduced by generative models. In this work, we propose a watermarking technique, called AudioMarkNet, to embed watermarks in original speech. The purpose is to prevent speech from being used for speaker adaptation (i.e., fine-tuning text-to-speech (TTS)), which is commonly used for generating high-fidelity fake speech. Our method is orthogonal to existing reactive detection methods. Experimental results demonstrate the success of our method in detecting fake speech generated by open-source and commercial TTS models. Moreover, our watermarking technique achieves robustness against common non-adaptive attacks. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against adaptive attacks. Examples of watermarked speech using our proposed method can be found on a website. Our code and artifacts are also available online."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/lin-chenhao",
    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks typically place a specific trigger on certain training data, such that the model makes prediction errors on inputs with that trigger during inference. Despite the core role of the trigger, existing studies have commonly believed a perfect match between training-inference triggers is optimal. In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the training-inference trigger relation, particularly focusing on their mismatch, based on a Training-Inference Trigger Intensity Manipulation (TITIM) workflow. TITIM specifically investigates the training-inference trigger intensity, such as the size or the opacity of a trigger, and reveals new insights into trigger generalization and overfitting. These new insights challenge the above common belief by demonstrating that the training-inference trigger mismatch can facilitate attacks in two practical scenarios, posing more significant security threats than previously thought. First, when the inference trigger is fixed, using training triggers with mixed intensities leads to stronger attacks than using any single intensity. For example, on CIFAR-10 with ResNet18, mixing training triggers with 1.0 and 0.1 opacities improves the worst-case attack success rate (ASR) (over different testing opacities) of the best single-opacity attack from 10.61% to 92.77%. Second, intentionally using certain mismatched training-inference triggers can improve the attack stealthiness, i.e., better bypassing defenses. For example, compared to the training/inference intensity of 1.0/1.0, using 1.0/0.7 decreases the area under the curve (AUC) of the Scale-Up defense from 0.96 to 0.62, while maintaining a high attack ASR (99.65% vs. 91.62%)."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zhang-yushu",
    "abstract": "Privacy and regulation are a long-lasting conflict in modern instant messaging, where the security community attempts to bridge this gap from a technological perspective. End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a mathematically guaranteed privacy policy that has been widely built into commercial instant messaging applications. On the other hand, regulatory designs compatible with E2EE privacy are severely restricted, i.e., content auditing is (almost) impossible on ciphertext. For this reason, the community develops perceptual hash matching (PHM) as a regulation policy, where content-aware hash codes for media are computed prior to E2EE and matched against known sensitive media, e.g., child pornography images, on the server side.\nIn this paper, we systematically reveal a range of adversarial threats to such E2EE-PHM systems, leading to regulatory failures. Unlike previous case studies, our attack is a more realistic threat â uniformly fooling the famous Microsoft PhotoDNA, Facebook PDQ, Apple NeuralHash, and pHash, even with higher success rates and less training rounds. Here, we validate the above proposition in both scenarios of escaping and triggering regulation. \nOur main contribution is a new idea of multiresolution perturbation, where each perturbation element can affect image regions of adjustable scales. With this new idea and its well-formalized design, our attack encapsulates previous attacks as special cases â in some scenarios, it exhibits a huge leap in convergence efficiency compared to previous ones. Based on the above technical insights, we also discuss possible countermeasures and recommendations for social good."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/guo-hao",
    "abstract": "Multiplication and non-linear operations are well known to be the most expensive protocols in secure two-party computation (2PC). Moreover, the comparison protocol (or Wrap protocol) is essential for various operations such as truncation, signed extension, and signed non-uniform multiplication. This paper aims to optimize these protocols by avoiding invoking the costly comparison protocol, thereby improving their efficiency.\nWe propose a novel approach to study 2PC from a geometric perspective. Specifically, we interpret the two shares of a secret as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system, with the secret itself represented as the corresponding point. This reformulation allows us to address the comparison problem by determining the region where the point lies. Furthermore, we identify scenarios where the costly comparison protocol can be replaced by more efficient evaluating AND gate protocols within a constrained range. Using this method, we improve protocols for truncation, signed extension and signed non-uniform multiplication, all of which are fundamental to 2PC. In particular, for the one-bit error truncation protocol and signed extension protocols, we reduce the state-of-the-art communication complexities of Cheetah (USENIX'22) and SirNN (S\\&P '21) from â Î» (l+1) to âÎ» in two rounds, where l is the input length and Î» is the security parameter. For signed multiplication with non-uniform bit-width, we reduce the communication cost of SirNN's by 40% to 60%."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zhang-zhisheng",
    "abstract": "Speech synthesis technology has brought great convenience, while the widespread usage of realistic deepfake audio has triggered hazards. Malicious adversaries may unauthorizedly collect victims' speeches and clone a similar voice for illegal exploitation (e.g., telecom fraud). However, the existing defense methods cannot effectively prevent deepfake exploitation and are vulnerable to robust training techniques. Therefore, a more effective and robust data protection method is urgently needed. In response, we propose a defensive framework, SafeSpeech, which protects the users' audio before uploading by embedding imperceptible perturbations on original speeches to prevent high-quality synthetic speech. In SafeSpeech, we devise a robust and universal proactive protection technique, Speech PErturbative Concealment (SPEC), that leverages a surrogate model to generate universally applicable perturbation for generative synthetic models. Moreover, we optimize the human perception of embedded perturbation in terms of time and frequency domains. To evaluate our method comprehensively, we conduct extensive experiments across advanced models and datasets, both subjectively and objectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that SafeSpeech achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) voice protection effectiveness and transferability and is highly robust against advanced adaptive adversaries. Moreover, SafeSpeech has real-time capability in real-world tests. The source code is available at https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech."

    "abstract": "We study the impact of Stack Overflow code evolution on the stability of prior research findings derived from Stack Overflow data and provide recommendations for future studies. We systematically reviewed papers published between 2005â2023 to identify key aspects of Stack Overflow that can affect study results, such as the language or context of code snippets. Our analysis reveals that certain aspects are non-stationary over time, which could lead to different conclusions if experiments are repeated at different times. We replicated six studies using a more recent dataset to demonstrate this risk. Our findings show that four papers produced significantly different results than the original findings, preventing the same conclusions from being drawn with a newer dataset version. Consequently, we recommend treating Stack Overflow as a time series data source to provide context for interpreting cross-sectional research conclusions."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/shao",
    "abstract": "Microcontroller-based IoT devices often use embedded real-time operating systems (RTOSs). Vulnerabilities in these embedded RTOSs can lead to compromises of those IoT devices. Despite the significance of security protections, the absence of standardized security guidelines results in various levels of security risk across RTOS implementations. Our initial analysis reveals that popular RTOSs such as FreeRTOS lack essential security protections. While Zephyr OS and ThreadX are designed and implemented with essential security protections, our closer examination uncovers significant differences in their implementations of system call parameter sanitization. We identify a performance optimization practice in ThreadX that introduces security vulnerabilities, allowing for the circumvention of parameter sanitization processes. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel attack named the Kernel Object Masquerading (KOM) Attack (as the attacker needs to manipulate one or multiple kernel objects through carefully selected system calls to launch the attack), demonstrating how attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to access sensitive fields within kernel objects, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation, or system compromise. We introduce an automated approach involving under-constrained symbolic execution to identify the KOM attacks and to understand the implications. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of KOM attacks on ThreadX-powered platforms. We reported our findings to the vendors, who recognized the vulnerabilities, with Amazon and Microsoft acknowledging our contribution on their websites."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/bolcskei",
    "abstract": "Hardware fuzzing has recently gained momentum with many discovered bugs in open-source RISC-V CPU designs. Comparing the effectiveness of different hardware fuzzers, however, remains a challenge: each fuzzer optimizes for a different metric and is demonstrated on different CPU designs. Furthermore, the number of newly-discovered bugs is not an appropriate metric since finding new bugs becomes increasingly more difficult as designs mature. We argue that a corpus of automatically injectable bugs will help compare hardware fuzzers to better understand their strengths and weaknesses. Through a large-scale study of 177 software-observable bugs in open-source RISC-V CPUs, we discover that CPU bugs can be modelled by manipulating conditional statements or signal drivers. Based on this observation, we design Encarsia, a framework that automatically transforms the intermediate representation of a given CPU design to inject bugs that are equivalent to incorrect conditions or assignments at the HDL level. To ensure that an injected bug has an observable architectural effect, we leverage formal methods to prove the existence of an architectural deviation due to the bug-specific transformation. We evaluate Encarsia by injecting bugs into three open-source RISC-V CPUs, fuzzing these CPUs with recently-proposed CPU fuzzers, and comparing their bug-finding performance. Our experiments reveal key insights into the limitations of existing hardware fuzzers, including their inability to cover large sections of the designs under test, ineffective coverage metrics, and bug detection mechanisms that often miss bugs or produce false positives, highlighting the urgent need to reassess current approaches."

    "abstract": "Many blockchain networks aim to preserve the anonymity of validators in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network, ensuring that no adversary can link a validator's identifier to the IP address of a peer due to associated privacy and security concerns.\nThis work demonstrates that the Ethereum P2P network does not offer this anonymity. We present a methodology that enables any node in the network to identify validators hosted on connected peers and empirically verify the feasibility of our proposed method. Using data collected from four nodes over three days, we locate more than 15% of Ethereum validators in the P2P network. The insights gained from our deanonymization technique provide valuable information on the distribution of validators across peers, their geographic locations, and hosting organizations. We further discuss the implications and risks associated with the lack of anonymity in the P2P network and propose methods to help validators protect their privacy.\nThe Ethereum Foundation has awarded us a bug bounty, acknowledging the impact of our results."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/van-der-horst",
    "abstract": "As ransomware attacks grow in frequency and complexity, accurate attribution is crucial. Victim organizations often feel compelled to pay ransom, but must first attribute the attack and conduct sanction screening to ensure the threat actor receiving the payment is not a sanctioned entity, avoiding severe legal and financial risks. This cyber threat actor attribution process typically relies on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) matching known threat profiles. However, the emergence of the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem and rebranding behavior complicate attribution for sanction screening.\nOur mixed-methods study, combining interviews with 20 experts with an analysis of ransomware incident reports, reveals significant challenges and limitations in the current attribution process. High-level IoCs, widely regarded as more reliable, lack the necessary specificity for accurate attribution, leading to potential risks of misattribution. Practitioners rely on lower-level IoCs, which provide clearer links to threat actors but are highly volatile, further complicating sanction enforcement. These challenges highlight the need for urgent improvements in the attribution and sanction processes.\nTo mitigate these risks, we offer recommendations aimed at enhancing data-sharing practices, improving attributions frameworks, and refining the sanction violation policy to better support sanction screening efforts. While we do not recommend paying ransomware actors, we acknowledge that some organizations may face pressures to do so in certain situations. In such cases, it is vital to ensure legal compliance, particularly regarding sanctioned entities. This work aims to help victims of ransomware shield themselves from transgressing against sanctions."

    "abstract": "A computing device typically identifies itself by exhibiting unique measurable behavior or by proving its knowledge of a secret. In both cases, the identifying device must reveal information to a verifier. Considerable research has focused on protecting identifying entities (provers) and reducing the amount of leaked data. However, little has been done to conceal the fact that the verification occurred.\nWe show how this problem naturally arises in the context of digital emblems, which were recently proposed by the International Committee of the Red Cross to protect digital resources during cyber-conflicts. To address this new and important open problem, we define a new primitive, called an Oblivious Digital Token (ODT) that can be verified obliviously. Verifiers can use this procedure to check whether a device has an ODT without revealing to any other parties (including the device itself) that this check occurred. We demonstrate the feasibility of ODTs and present a concrete construction that provably meets the ODT security requirements, even if the prover device's software is fully compromised. We also implement a prototype of the proposed construction and evaluate its performance, thereby confirming its practicality."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zhang-bo",
    "abstract": "Oblivious RAM (ORAM) has been attracting significant attention for building encrypted data storage systems due to its strong security guarantees and communities' continuing effort in improving its efficiency. Despite great potential, a specific ORAM scheme is normally designed and optimized for a certain type of client workloads, given the nature of its complicated cryptographic construction. Once deployed, a single ORAM service can hardly serve dynamic workloads in an efficient and cost-effective manner. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a versatile ORAM framework named V-ORAM, which can efficiently and securely switch between different ORAM services to adaptively serve dynamic workloads in the real-world. In particular, V-ORAM is equipped with a service transformation protocol that leverages a base ORAM as an intermedia of transformation and can synchronize the states of tree-based ORAMs without downloading and rebuilding the ORAM by the client. We formalize the security of V-ORAM, and prove that V-ORAM holds the security of ORAMs, including the process of service transformation. V-ORAM also provides a planner to recommend the ORAM service type and ORAM parameters for adapting to the client workloads, server resources and monetary expenses. We implement V-ORAM and evaluate the cost of transformation. We also conduct real-world case studies over three medical datasets and different workloads. Compared with directly rebuilding ORAMs, V-ORAM saves up to 10^4.12x processing time and communication cost, up to 33.1% of monetary costs in real-world workloads, and generates constant impact to employed ORAM services, i.e., < 5ms in processing and < 50KB in communication."

Updating algorithms (e.g., SHA-1 to SHA-512), key sizes (e.g., 2048 to 4096 bits), protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 to 1.3), or transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are common objectives of cryptographic updates. However, previous work and recent incidents illustrate developers' struggle with cryptographic updates. The research illustrates that many software products include outdated and insecure cryptographic code and libraries. However, the security community lacks a solid understanding of cryptographic updates. We conducted an interview study with 21 experienced software developers to address this research gap. We wanted to learn about their experiences, approaches, challenges, and needs. Our participants updated for security and non-security reasons and generally perceived cryptographic updates as challenging and tedious. They lacked structured processes and faced significant challenges, such as insufficient cryptographic knowledge, legacy support hindering cryptographic transition, and a lack of helpful guidance. Participants desired the assistance of cryptographic experts and understandable resources for successful updates. We conclude with recommendations for developers, academia, standards organizations, and the upcoming transition to PCQ."

To mitigate tracking, privacy-aware users are motivated to optimize their privacy setups by adopting proposed anti-fingerprinting configurations and customizing ad blocker settings to maximize the number of blocked trackers. \nHowever, users' choices can counter-intuitively undermine their privacy. In this work, we quantify the risk incurred by modifying ad-blocker filter-list selections. We evaluate the fingerprintability of ad-blocker customization and its implications on privacy. We present three scriptless attacks that evade SoTA fingerprinting detectors and mitigations. Our attacks identify 84% of filter lists, capture stable fingerprints with 0.72 normalized entropy, and reduce the relative anonymity set of users to a median of 48 users (0.2% of the population) using only 45 rules out of 577K. Finally, we provide recommendations and precautionary measures to all parties involved."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/qu-watermarking",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities of generating texts resembling human language. However, they can be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to address these concerns, which embeds a message (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by an LLM. By embedding the user ID (represented as a bit string) into generated texts, we can trace generated texts to the user, known as content source tracing. The major limitation of existing watermarking techniques is that they achieve sub-optimal performance for content source tracing in real-world scenarios. The reason is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract a long message from a generated text. We aim to address the limitations.\nIn this work, we introduce a new watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in pseudo-random segment assignment. We also propose multiple techniques to further enhance the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a much better tradeoff between extraction accuracy and time complexity, compared with existing baselines. For instance, when embedding a message of length 20 into a 200-token generated text, our method achieves a match rate of 97.6%, while the state-of-the-art work Yoo et al. only achieves 49.2%. Additionally, we prove that our watermark can tolerate edits within an edit distance of 17 on average for each paragraph under the same setting."

In this work, we perform a systematic measurement study to benchmark large language model (LLM) based personal information extraction and countermeasures. Towards this goal, we present a framework for LLM-based extraction attacks; collect four datasets including a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 and three real-world datasets with manually labeled eight categories of personal information; introduce a novel mitigation strategy based on prompt injection; and systematically benchmark LLM-based attacks and countermeasures using ten LLMs and five datasets. Our key findings include: LLM can be misused by attackers to accurately extract various personal information from personal profiles; LLM outperforms traditional methods; and prompt injection can defend against strong LLM-based attacks, reducing the attack to less effective traditional ones."

In this study we show how to evaluate websites' compliance with GPC. Using longitudinal data collected by crawling a set of 11,708 sites, we show the extent to which sites are respecting California residents' opt out rights expressed via GPC. We do so by examining the values of four privacy strings that indicate a web user's opt out status: the US Privacy String, the Global Privacy Platform String, the OptanonConsent cookie, and the .wellknown/gpc.json. We find that about a third of sites that have evidence of selling or sharing personal information per the CCPA implement at least one of the four privacy strings. In December 2023, 44% (1,411/3,226) of such sites opted users out via all implemented privacy strings. In February 2024, this percentage decreased to 43% (1,473/3,402) before increasing to 45% (1,620/3,566) in April 2024. Despite the slight uptick between December 2023 and April 2024, compliance rates remained at a low level overall, indicating widespread disregard for California residents' right to opt out.

With as few as 8 interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify 42 different LLM versions with over 95% accuracy. More importantly, LLMmap is designed to be robust across different application layers, allowing it to identify LLM versions âwhether open-source or proprietaryâ from various vendors, operating under various unknown system prompts, stochastic sampling hyperparameters, and even complex generation frameworks such as RAG or Chain-of-Thought. We discuss potential mitigations and demonstrate that, against resourceful adversaries, effective countermeasures may be challenging or even unrealizable."

Researchers have developed various techniques to support these efforts. However, security practitioners' perceptions and challenges in analyzing APT-level threats are not yet well understood. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 security practitioners across diverse roles and expertise. From the interview responses, we identify a three-layer approach to APT attribution, each having its own goals and challenges. We find that practitioners typically prioritize understanding the adversary's tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs), and motivations over identifying the specific entity behind an attack. We also find challenges in existing tools and processes mostly stemming from their inability to handle diverse and complex data and issues with both internal and external collaboration. Based on these findings, we provide four recommendations for improving attribution approaches and discuss how these improvements can address the identified challenges."

    "abstract": "Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to Internet users, with cybercriminals elaborately replicating the visual appearance of legitimate websites to deceive victims. Visual similarity-based detection systems have emerged as an effective countermeasure, but their effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios have been underexplored. In this paper, we comprehensively scrutinize and evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of popular visual similarity-based anti-phishing models using a large-scale dataset of 451k real-world phishing websites. Our analyses of the effectiveness reveal that while certain visual similarity-based models achieve high accuracy on curated datasets in the experimental settings, they exhibit notably low performance on real-world datasets, highlighting the importance of real-world evaluation. Furthermore, we find that the attackers evade the detectors mainly in three ways: (1) directly attacking the model pipelines, (2) mimicking benign logos, and (3) employing relatively simple strategies such as eliminating logos from screenshots. To statistically assess the resilience and robustness of existing models against adversarial attacks, we categorize the strategies attackers employ into visible and perturbation-based manipulations and apply them to website logos. We then evaluate the models' robustness using these adversarial samples. Our findings reveal potential vulnerabilities in several models, emphasizing the need for more robust visual similarity techniques capable of withstanding sophisticated evasion attempts. We provide actionable insights for enhancing the security of phishing defense systems, encouraging proactive actions."

Oblivious sorting is a fundamental building block in the design of oblivious algorithms for numerous computation tasks. Unfortunately, there is still a theory-practice gap for oblivious sort. The commonly implemented bitonic sorting algorithm is not asymptotically optimal, whereas known asymptotically optimal algorithms suffer from large constants.\nIn this paper, we construct a new oblivious sorting algorithm called flexway o-sort, which is asymptotically optimal, concretely efficient, and suitable for implementation in hardware enclaves such as Intel SGX. For moderately large inputs of 12 GB, our flexway o-sort algorithm outperforms known oblivious sorting algorithms by 1.32x to $28.8x when the data fits within the hardware enclave, and by 4.1x to 208x when the data does not fit within the hardware enclave. We also implemented various applications of oblivious sorting, including histogram, database join, and initialization of an ORAM data structure. For these applications and data sets from 8GB to 32GB, we achieve 1.44 â¼ 2.3x speedup over bitonic sort when the data fits within the enclave, and 4.9 â¼ 5.5x speedup when the data does not fit within the enclave."

Deploying our system over an 18-month period, we track the spread of 146K news stories across over 4,000 websites. Using network-based interference via the NETINF algorithm, we show that the paths of news stories and the stances of websites toward particular entities can be used to uncover slanted propaganda networks (e.g., anti-vaccine and anti-Ukraine) and to identify the most influential websites in spreading these attitudes in the broader news ecosystem. We hope that the increased visibility into news ecosystems that our system provides assists with the reporting and fact-checking of propaganda and disinformation."

AKMA+ includes countermeasures for protecting communication between the user equipment (UE) and application functions (AFs) from attackers, including those within the home public land mobile network. These countermeasures ensure mutual authentication between the UE and the AKMA anchor function without altering the protocol flow. We also address vulnerabilities related to subscriber and AKMA key identifiers that could be exploited in linkability attacks. By obfuscating this data, AKMA+ prevents attackers from associating a target UE with its past application access. \nWe employ formal verification to demonstrate that AKMA+ achieves key security and privacy objectives. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that AKMA+ incurs acceptable computational overhead, bandwidth costs, and UE battery consumption."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training among multiple clients without raw data exposure. However, recent studies have shown that clients' private training data can be reconstructed from shared gradients in FL, a vulnerability known as gradient inversion attacks (GIAs). While GIAs have demonstrated effectiveness under ideal settings and auxiliary assumptions, their actual efficacy against practical FL systems remains under-explored. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study on GIAs in this work. We start with a survey of GIAs that establishes a timeline to trace their evolution and develops a systematization to uncover their inherent threats. By rethinking GIA in practical FL systems, three fundamental aspects influencing GIA's effectiveness are identified: training setup, model, and post-processing. Guided by these aspects, we perform extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations of SOTA GIAs across diverse settings. Our findings highlight that GIA is notably constrained, fragile, and easily defensible. Specifically, GIAs exhibit inherent limitations against practical local training settings. Additionally, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to the trained model, and even simple post-processing techniques applied to gradients can serve as effective defenses. Our work provides crucial insights into the limited threats of GIAs in practical FL systems. By rectifying prior misconceptions, we hope to inspire more accurate and realistic investigations on this topic."

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve the state-of-the-art on graph-relevant tasks such as node and graph classification. However, recent works show GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations include the perturbation on edges, nodes, and node features, the three components forming a graph. Empirical defenses against such attacks are soon broken by adaptive ones. While certified defenses offer robustness guarantees, they face several limitations: 1) almost all restrict the adversary's capability to only one type of perturbation, which is impractical; 2) all are designed for a particular GNN task, which limits their applicability; and 3) the robustness guarantees of all methods except one are not 100% accurate.\nWe address all these limitations by developing AGNNCert, the first certified defense for GNNs against arbitrary (edge, node, and node feature) perturbations with deterministic robustness guarantees, and applicable to the two most common node and graph classification tasks. AGNNCert also encompass existing certified defenses as special cases. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark node/graph classification datasets and two real-world graph datasets, and multiple GNNs validate the effectiveness of AGNNCert to provably defend against arbitrary perturbations. AGNNCert also shows its superiority over the state-of-the-art certified defenses against the individual edge perturbation and node perturbation."

    "abstract": "Fully asynchronous multi-party computation (AMPC) has superior robustness in realizing privacy and guaranteed output delivery (G.O.D.) against asynchronous adversaries that can arbitrarily delay communications. However, none of these protocols are truly practical, as they either have sub-optimal resilience, incur cumbersome communication cost, or suffer from an online phase with extra cryptographic overhead. The only attempting implementationâHoneyBadgerMPC (hbMPC)âmerely ensures G.O.D. in some implausible optimistic cases due to a non-robust offline pre-processing phase.\nWe propose Dumbo-MPC a concretely efficient AMPC-as-a-service design with all-phase G.O.D. and optimal resilience against t < n/3 malicious parties (where n is the total number of parties). Similar to hbMPC, Dumbo-MPC has a robust (almost) information-theoretic online phase that can efficiently perform online computations, given pre-processed multiplication triples. To achieve all-phase G.O.D., we design a novel dual-mode offline protocol that can robustly pre-process multiplication triples in asynchrony. The offline phase features O(n) per-triple communication in the optimistic case, followed by a fully asynchronous fallback to a pessimistic path to securely restore G.O.D. in the bad case. To (concretely) efficiently implement the pessimistic path, we devise a concretely efficient zk-proof for the product relationship of secret shares over compact KZG polynomial commitments, which enables us to reduce the degree of two secret shares' product from 2t to t and could be of independent interest.\nWe also implement and extensively evaluate Dumbo-MPC (particularly its offline phase) in varying network settings with up to 31 AWS servers. To our knowledge, we provide the first AMPC implementation with all-phase G.O.D. A recent asynchronous triple generation protocol from Groth and Shoup (GS23) is also implemented and experimentally compared. When n = 31, Dumbo-MPC generates 94 triples/sec (almost twice as many as GS23) in the pessimistic case and 349 triples/sec (about 6X of GS23) in the good case."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely employed for their ability to generate human-like text. However, service providers may deploy smaller models to reduce costs, potentially deceiving users. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a solution by allowing providers to prove LLM inference without compromising the privacy of model parameters. Existing solutions either do not support LLM architectures or suffer from significant inefficiency and tremendous overhead. To address this issue, this paper introduces several new techniques. We propose new methods to efficiently prove linear and non-linear layers in LLMs, reducing computation overhead by orders of magnitude. To further enhance efficiency, we propose constraint fusion to reduce the overhead of proving non-linear layers and circuit squeeze to improve parallelism. We implement our efficient protocol, specifically tailored for popular LLM architectures like GPT-2, and deploy optimizations to enhance performance. Experiments show that our scheme can prove GPT-2 inference in less than 25 seconds. Compared with state-of-the-art systems such as Hao et al. (USENIX Security'24) and ZKML (Eurosys'24), our work achieves nearly 279x and 185x speedup, respectively."

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained widespread adoption in control and decision-making tasks due to its strong performance in dynamic environments. However, DRL agents are vulnerable to noisy observations and adversarial attacks, and concerns about the adversarial robustness of DRL systems have emerged. Recent efforts have focused on addressing these robustness issues by establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the returns achieved by DRL agents in adversarial settings. Among these approaches, policy smoothing has proven to be an effective and scalable method for certifying the robustness of DRL agents. Nevertheless, existing certifiably robust DRL relies on policies trained with simple Gaussian augmentations, resulting in a suboptimal trade-off between certified robustness and certified return. To address this issue, we introduce a novel paradigm dubbed Certified-rAdius-Maximizing Policy (CAMP) training. CAMP is designed to enhance DRL policies, achieving better utility without compromising provable robustness. By leveraging the insight that the global certified radius can be derived from local certified radii based on training-time statistics, CAMP formulates a surrogate loss related to the local certified radius and optimizes the policy guided by this surrogate loss. We also introduce policy imitation as a novel technique to stabilize CAMP training. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMP significantly improves the robustness-return trade-off across various tasks. Based on the results, CAMP can achieve up to twice the certified expected return compared to that of baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/NeuralSec/camp-robust-rl."

    "abstract": "Fake base stations (FBSes) pose a significant security threat by impersonating legitimate base stations (BSes). Though efforts have been made to defeat this threat, up to this day, the presence of FBSes and the multi-step attacks (MSAs) stemming from them can lead to unauthorized surveillance, interception of sensitive information, and disruption of network services. Therefore, detecting these malicious entities is crucial to ensure the security and reliability of cellular networks. In this paper, we develop FBSDetector-an effective and efficient detection solution that can reliably detect FBSes and MSAs from layer-3 network traces using machine learning (ML) at the user equipment (UE) side. To develop FBSDetector, we create FBSAD and MSAD, the first-ever high-quality and large-scale datasets incorporating instances of FBSes and 21 MSAs. These datasets capture the network traces in different real-world cellular network scenarios (including mobility and different attacker capabilities) incorporating legitimate BSes and FBSes. Our novel ML framework, specifically designed to detect FBSes in a multi-level approach for packet classification using stateful LSTM with attention and trace level classification and MSAs using graph learning, can effectively detect FBSes with an accuracy of 96% and a false positive rate of 2.96%, and recognize MSAs with an accuracy of 86% and a false positive rate of 3.28%. We deploy FBSDetector as a real-world solution to protect end-users through a mobile app and extensively validate it in real-world environments. Compared to the existing heuristic-based solutions that fail to detect FBSes, FBSDetector can detect FBSes in the wild in real time."

    "abstract": "Signature schemes are a fundamental component of cybersecurity infrastructure. While they are designed to be mathematically secure against cryptographic attacks, they are vulnerable to Rowhammer fault-injection attacks. Since all existing attacks are ad-hoc in that they target individual parameters of specific signature schemes, it remains unclear about the impact of Rowhammer on signature schemes as a whole.\nIn this paper, we present Achilles, a formal framework that aids in leaking secrets in various real-world signature schemes via Rowhammer. Particularly, Achilles can be used to find potentially more vulnerable parameters in schemes that have been studied before and also new schemes that are potentially vulnerable. Achilles mainly describes a formal procedure where Rowhammer faults are induced to key parameters of a generalized signature scheme, called G-sign, and a post-Rowhammer analysis is then performed for secret recovery on it. To illustrate the viability of Achilles, we have evaluated six signature schemes (with five CVEs assigned to track their respective Rowhammer vulnerability), covering traditional and post-quantum signatures with different mathematical problems. Based on the analysis with Achilles, all six schemes are proved to be vulnerable, and two new vulnerable parameters are identified for EdDSA. Further, we demonstrate a successful Rowhammer attack against each of these schemes, using recent cryptographic libraries including wolfssl, relic, and liboqs."

Threading the tightrope of AML, KYC and SCA regulations, we provide two privacy-enhancing, EMV-compatible, law-abiding and practicable contactless-payments protocols: PrivBank and PrivProxy. \nWe do not use privacy-enhancing technology, like homomorphic encryption, that would break backwards-compatibility with current EMV, but rather we do privacy by engineering design, adhering to the existing EMV infrastructure, as is. So, PrivBank and PrivProxy provably achieve strong notions of payers and merchant privacy, anonymity and unlinkability as seen in e-cash or shopping vouchers, whilst being implementable in EMV as it stands."

    "abstract": "The Signal protocol relies on a special handshake protocol, formerly X3DH and now PQXDH, to set up secure conversations. Prior analysis of these protocols (or proposals for post-quantum alternatives) have all used highly tailored models to the individual protocols and generally made ad-hoc adaptations to \"standard\" AKE definitions, making the concrete security attained unclear and hard to compare. Indeed, we observe that some natural Signal handshake protocols cannot be handled by these tailored models. In this work, we introduce Bundled Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE), a concrete treatment of the Signal handshake protocol. We formally model prekey bundles and states, enabling us to define various levels of security in a unified model. We analyze Signal's classically secure X3DH and harvest-now-decrypt-later-secure PQXDH, and show that they do not achieve what we call optimal security (as is documented). Next, we introduce RingXKEM, a fully post-quantum Signal handshake protocol achieving optimal security; as RingXKEM shares states among many prekey bundles, it could not have been captured by prior models. Lastly, we provide security and efficiency comparison of X3DH, PQXDH, and RingXKEM."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/wang-xunguang",
    "abstract": "Jailbreaking is an emerging adversarial attack that bypasses the safety alignment deployed in off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) and has evolved into multiple categories: human-based, optimization-based, generation-based, and the recent indirect and multilingual jailbreaks. However, delivering a practical jailbreak defense is challenging because it needs to not only handle all the above jailbreak attacks but also incur negligible delays to user prompts, as well as be compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.\nInspired by how the traditional security concept of shadow stacks defends against memory overflow attacks, this paper introduces a generic LLM jailbreak defense framework called SelfDefend, which establishes a shadow LLM as a defense instance (in detection state) to concurrently protect the target LLM instance (in normal answering state) in the normal stack and collaborate with it for checkpoint-based access control. The effectiveness of SelfDefend builds upon our observation that existing LLMs can identify harmful prompts or intentions in user queries, which we empirically validate using mainstream GPT-3.5/4 models against major jailbreak attacks. To further improve the defense's robustness and minimize costs, we employ a data distillation approach to tune dedicated open-source defense models. When deployed to protect GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Llama-2-7b/13b, and Mistral, these models outperform seven state-of-the-art defenses and match the performance of GPT-4-based SelfDefend, with significantly lower extra delays. Further experiments show that the tuned models are robust to adaptive jailbreaks and prompt injections."

The final paper PDF will be available on the first day of the conference.The transaction fee mechanism (TFM) in blockchain prevents resource abuse by charging users based on resource usage, but inconsistencies between charged fees and actual resource consumption, termed as TFM inconsistency bugs, introduce significant security and financial risks.\nIn this paper, we present Auspex, the first tool that automatically detects TFM inconsistency bugs in Ethereum ecosystem by leveraging fuzzing technology. To efficiently trigger and identify TFM inconsistency bugs, Auspex introduces three novel technologies: (i) a chain-based test case generation strategy that enables Auspex to efficiently generate the test cases; (ii) a charging-guided fuzzing approach that guides Auspex to explore more code logic; and (iii) fee consistency property and resource consistency property, two general bug oracles for automatically detecting bugs. We evaluate Auspex on Ethereum and demonstrate its effectiveness by discovering 13 previously unknown TFM inconsistency bugs, and achieving 3.5 times more code branches than state-of-the-art tools. We further explore the financial and security impact of the bugs. On one hand, these bugs have caused losses exceeding millions of dollars for users on both Ethereum and BSC. On the other hand, the denial-of-service (DoS) attack exploiting these bugs can prolong transaction wait time by 4.5 times during the attack period."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Diffusion Models (DMs) has marked a significant advancement in AI-generated image creation. However, this success has also spawned a new form of infringement threat termed the Diffusion Finetuning Attack (DFA), where malicious attackers can finetune pre-trained DMs using minimal resources to illicitly synthesize copyrightinfringing images by 'stealing' information from personal photographic data or artwork, raising critical concerns about privacy and intellectual property rights. Recognizing the limitations of current defense strategies, which exhibit inadequate generalizability and suboptimal mechanism efficacy, we introduce an universal and effective active defense mechanism that applies subtle protective noise to images, guarding against information theft from DFAs. Our work innovatively conceptualizes active defense as a bi-level optimization problem, focusing on attackers' common behaviors to enhance the generalization of defense. Guided by this optimization framework, we have developed a novel algorithm named Pretender, where we adversarially trained a surrogate model to facilitate the generation of more effective protective noise. In addition, a Simultaneous Gradient Back-Propagation (SGBP) technique is introduced to significantly enhance computational efficiency. Extensive experiments including real-world evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of Pretender. By applying minimal perturbations (p = 0.03), Pretender successfully disrupted the quality and semantics of images synthesized by diverse DFAs, achieving a comprehensive and prominent improvement in various automated evaluation metrics by 22.27% and in human assessment scores by 94.28%."

    "abstract": "The Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol has recently been standardized by the IETF. MLS is a scalable secure group messaging protocol expected to run more efficiently compared to the Signal protocol at scale, while offering a similar level of strong security. Even though MLS has undergone extensive examination by researchers, the majority of the works have focused on confidentiality.\nIn this work, we focus on the authenticity of the application messages exchanged in MLS. Currently, MLS authenticates every application message with an EdDSA signature and while manageable, the overhead is greatly amplified in the post-quantum setting as the NIST-recommended Dilithium signature results in a 40x increase in size. We view this as an invitation to explore new authentication modes that can be used instead. We start by taking a systematic view on how application messages are authenticated in MLS and categorize authenticity into four different security notions. We then propose several authentication modes, offering a range of different efficiency and security profiles. For instance, in one of our modes, COSMOS++, we replace signatures with one-time tokens and a MAC tag, offering roughly a 75x savings in the post-quantum communication overhead. While this comes at the cost of weakening security compared to the authentication mode used by MLS, the lower communication overhead seems to make it a worthwhile trade-off with security."

    "abstract": "Secure data alignment, which securely aligns the data between parties, is the first and crucial step in vertical privacy-preserving machine learning (VPPML). Practical applications, e.g. advertising, require VPPML for personalized services. Meanwhile, the data held by parties in these applications are usually unbalanced. Existing secure unbalanced data alignment approaches typically rely on Cuckoo Hashing, which introduces redundant data outside the intersection, leading to significantly increasing communication size during secure training in VPPML. Though secure shuffle operations can trim these redundant data, these operations would incur huge communication overhead. As a result, these secure approaches should be optimized for efficiency in VPPML scenarios.\nIn this paper, we propose Suda, an efficient and secure unbalanced data alignment framework for VPPML. By leveraging polynomial-based operations rather than Cuckoo Hashing, Suda efficiently, directly, and exclusively outputs data shares in the intersection without expensive secure shuffle operations. Consequently, Suda efficiently and seamlessly aligns with secure training in VPPML. Specifically, we first design a novel and efficient batch private information retrieval (PIR) protocol based on the oblivious polynomial reduction and evaluation protocols. Second, we design a batch PIR-to-share protocol extended from the batch PIR protocol with the oblivious polynomial interpolation protocol. Note that the batch PIR-to-share protocol securely obtains feature shares rather than the plaintext features which are the outputs of the batch PIR protocol. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that: (1) Suda outperforms the state-of-the-art secure data alignment framework by 31.14 x â¼ 210.78 x in communication size and up to 8.21 x in running time; and (2) Suda outperforms the state-of-the-art batch PIR framework by up to 11.53 x in server time."

To this end, Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs) provide an easily retrofittable approach to uncover attacks quickly and before they can cause significant damage. Current research focuses either on maximizing automation, usually through heavy use of machine learning, or on expert systems that rely on detailed knowledge of the monitored systems. While the former hinders the interpretability of alarms, the latter is impractical in real deployments due to excessive manual work for each individual deployment. To bridge the gap between maximizing automation and leveraging expert knowledge, we introduce GeCo, a novel IIDS based on automatically derived comprehensible models of benign system behavior. GeCo leverages state-space models mined from historical process data to minimize manual effort for operators while maintaining high detection performance and generalizability across diverse industrial domains. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art IIDSs and datasets demonstrates GeCo's superior performance while remaining comprehensible and performing on par with expert-derived rules. GeCo represents a critical step towards empowering operators with control over their cybersecurity toolset, thereby enhancing the protection of valuable physical processes in industrial control systems and critical infrastructures."

    "abstract": "WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format proposed by major browser vendors to achieve near-native performance on the web and other platforms. By design, Wasm modules should be executed in a memory-safe runtime, which acts as a trusted computing base. Therefore, security vulnerabilities inside runtime implementation can have severe impacts and should be identified and mitigated promptly.\nFuzzing is a practical and widely adopted technique for uncovering bugs in real-world programs. However, to apply fuzzing effectively to the domain of Wasm runtimes, it is vital to address two primary challenges: (1) Wasm is a stack-based language and runtimes should verify the correctness of stack semantics, which requires fuzzers to meticulously maintain desired stack semantics to reach deeper states. (2) Wasm acts as a compilation target and includes hundreds of instructions, making it hard for fuzzers to explore different combinations of instructions and cover the input space effectively.\nTo address these challenges, we design and implement Waltzz, a practical greybox fuzzing framework tailored for Wasm runtimes. Specifically, Waltzz proposes the concept of stack-invariant code transformation to preserve appropriate stack semantics during fuzzing. Next, Waltzz introduces a versatile suite of mutators designed to systematically traverse diverse combinations of instructions in terms of both control and data flow. Moreover, Waltzz designs a skeleton-based generation algorithm to produce code snippets that are rarely seen in the seed corpus. To demonstrate the efficacy of Waltzz, we evaluate it on seven well-known Wasm runtimes. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, Waltzz can surpass the nearest competitor by finding 12.4% more code coverage even within the large code bases and uncovering 1.38x more unique bugs. Overall, Waltzz has discovered 20 new bugs which have all been confirmed and 17 CVE IDs have been assigned."

    "abstract": "As bug-finding methods improve, bug-fixing capabilities are exceeded, resulting in an accumulation of potential vulnerabilities. There is thus a need for efficient and precise bug prioritization based on exploitability. In this work, we explore the notion of control of an attacker over a vulnerability's parameters, which is an often overlooked factor of exploitability. We show that taint as well as straightforward qualitative and quantitative notions of control are not enough to effectively differentiate vulnerabilities. Instead, we propose to focus analysis on feasible value sets, which we call domains of control, in order to better take into account threat models and expert insight. Our new Shrink and Split algorithm efficiently extracts domains of control from path constraints obtained with symbolic execution and renders them in an easily processed, human-readable form. This in turn allows to automatically compute more complex control metrics, such as weighted Quantitative Control, which factors in the varying threat levels of different values. Experiments show that our method is both efficient and precise. In particular, it is the only one able to distinguish between vulnerabilities such as cve-2019-14192 and cve-2022-30552, while revealing a mistake in the human evaluation of cve-2022-30790. The high degree of automation of our tool also brings us closer to a fully-automated evaluation pipeline."

Our preliminary investigation demonstrates that poisoning attacks are a viable method to achieve this goal but uncovers significant side effects, where unintended spread to non-targeted prompts compromises attack stealthiness. Root cause analysis identifies conceptual similarity as an important contributing factor to these side effects. To address this, we propose a stealthy poisoning attack method that balances covertness and performance. Our findings highlight the potential risks of adopting text-to-image models in real-world scenarios, thereby calling for future research and safety measures in this space."

    "abstract": "The combination of Oblivious RAM (ORAM) with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) has found numerous real-world applications due to their complementary nature. TEEs alleviate the performance bottlenecks of ORAM, such as network bandwidth and roundtrip latency, and ORAM provides general-purpose protection for TEE applications against attacks exploiting memory access patterns. The defining property of this combination, which sets it apart from traditional ORAM designs, is its ability to ensure that memory accesses, both inside and outside of TEEs, are made oblivious, thus termed doubly oblivious RAM (O2RAM). Efforts to develop O2RAM with enhanced performance have been ongoing.\nIn this work, we propose H2O2RAM, a high-performance doubly oblivious RAM construction. The distinguishing feature of our approach, compared with the existing tree-based doubly oblivious designs, is its first adoption of the hierarchical framework that enjoys inherently better data locality and parallelization. While the latest hierarchical solution, FutORAMa, achieves concrete efficiency in the classic client-server model by leveraging a relaxed assumption of sublinear-sized client-side private memory, adapting it to our scenario poses challenges due to the conflict between this relaxed assumption and our doubly oblivious requirement. To this end, we introduce several new efficient oblivious components to build a high-performance hierarchical O2RAM (H2O2RAM). We implement our design and evaluate it on various scenarios. The results indicate that H2O2RAM reduces execution time by up to â¼10^3 times and saves memory usage by a factor of 5â¼44 compared with state-of-the-art solutions."

    "abstract": "We present the formal verification of Apple's iMessage PQ3, a highly performant, device-to-device messaging protocol offering strong security guarantees even against an adversary with quantum computing capabilities. PQ3 leverages Apple's identity services together with a custom, post-quantum secure initialization phase and afterwards it employs a double ratchet construction in the style of Signal, extended to provide post-quantum, post-compromise security.\nWe present a detailed formal model of PQ3, a precise specification of its fine-grained security properties, and machine-checked security proofs using the TAMARIN prover. Particularly novel is the integration of post-quantum secure key encapsulation into the relevant protocol phases and the detailed security claims along with their complete formal analysis. Our analysis covers both key ratchets, including unbounded loops, which was believed by some to be out of scope of symbolic provers like TAMARIN (it is not!)."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/song-xiangpu",
    "abstract": "MQTT is a multi-party communication protocol widely used in IoT environments, where MQTT brokers act as servers that connect with numerous devices. Consequently, any flaws in brokers will seriously impact all participants. Given the success of fuzzing techniques in finding bugs in programs, existing fuzzing works targeting MQTT brokers face the limitation of insufficient fuzzing input space because they all adopt a two-party fuzzing model. Accordingly, the code responsible for handling multi-party communication will not be examined. Moreover, existing fuzzers focus on either memory corruption bugs or logic errors without considering whether a broker implementation is specification-compliant.\nIn this paper, we design a black-box fuzzing approach, MBFuzzer, for brokers to address the above limitations. We first design a multi-party fuzzing framework containing two fuzzing input senders to facilitate the exploration of code space that handles multi-party communication. To improve fuzzing efficiency, we design a message priority scheduler and a model based on Petri net to guide test case generation and coordinate the message sending of the two senders, respectively. We leverage differential testing to identify non-compliance bugs and design an LLM-based non-compliance bug analysis method to automatically analyze the bug report and validate whether it is a non-compliance bug. We implemented a prototype MBFuzzer and evaluated it with six mainstream MQTT brokers. MBFuzzer successfully identified 73 bugs including 20 memory corruption and 53 non-compliance bugs with 11 CVEs assigned. The comparison with state-of-the-art fuzzers indicates that MBFuzzer outperforms them in both code coverage and bug finding capabilities."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/morita",
    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables multiple distrusting parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private. Computing the AES block cipher in MPC, where the key and/or the input are secret-shared among the parties is important for various applications, particularly threshold cryptography.\nIn this work, we propose a family of dedicated, high-performance MPC protocols to compute the non-linear S-box part of AES in the honest majority setting. Our protocols come in both semi-honest and maliciously secure variants. The core technique is a combination of lookup table protocols based on random one-hot vectors and the decomposition of finite field inversion in GF(2^8) into multiplications and inversion in the smaller field GF(2^4), taking inspiration from ideas used for hardware implementations of AES. We also apply and improve the analysis of a batch verification technique for checking inner products with logarithmic communication. This allows us to obtain malicious security with almost no communication overhead, and we use it to obtain new, secure table lookup protocols with only O(\\sqrt{N}) communication for a table of size N, which may be useful in other applications.\nOur protocols have different trade-offs, such as having a similar round complexity as previous state-of-the-art by Chida et al. [WAHC '18] but 37% lower bandwidth costs, or having 27% fewer rounds and 16% lower bandwidth costs. An experimental evaluation in various network conditions using three party replicated secret sharing shows improvements in throughput between 28% and 71% in the semi-honest setting. For malicious security, we improve throughput by 319% to 384% in LAN and by 717% in WAN due to sublinear batch verification."

To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study targeting implementations vulnerable to DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks within cryptographic libraries. Notably, we observed that these vulnerable implementations are frequently associated, directly or indirectly, with X.509 certificates. Consequently, we facilitate the launch of DoS attacks by using crafted X.509 certificates as attack vectors, which we termed X.509DoS in this work.\nLeveraging the tool we developed for rapid generation of crafted certificates and detection of DoS vulnerabilities, we successfully discovered 18 new vulnerabilities and identified 12 previously known CVEs across seven mainstream cryptographic libraries. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting and detecting DoS vulnerabilities via X.509 certificates, revealing that X.509DoS is a widespread threat that has not been well-studied previously. Our work also shows that strict adherence to textbooks or standards does not guarantee security, highlighting the need for cryptographic library developers to pay more attention to real-world considerations."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/wu-yixin-auditing",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the generation of high-quality, cost-effective synthetic data for developing downstream models and conducting statistical analyses in various domains. However, the increased reliance on synthetic data may pose potential negative impacts. Numerous studies have demonstrated that LLM-generated synthetic data can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases and stereotypes, and produce erroneous outputs known as \"hallucinations'' that deviate from factual knowledge. In this paper, we aim to audit artifacts, such as classifiers, generators, or statistical plots, to identify those trained on or derived from synthetic data and raise user awareness, thereby reducing unexpected consequences and risks in downstream applications. To this end, we take the first step to introduce synthetic artifact auditing to assess whether a given artifact is derived from LLM-generated synthetic data. We then propose an auditing framework with three methods including metric-based auditing, tuning-based auditing, and classification-based auditing. These methods operate without requiring the artifact owner to disclose proprietary training details. We evaluate our auditing framework on three text classification tasks, two text summarization tasks, and two data visualization tasks across three training scenarios. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of all proposed auditing methods across all these tasks. For instance, black-box metric-based auditing can achieve an average accuracy of 0.868 pm 0.071 for auditing classifiers and 0.880 pm 0.052 for auditing generators using only 200 random queries across three scenarios. We hope our research will enhance model transparency and regulatory compliance, ensuring the ethical and responsible use of synthetic data."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/wang-chuhan",
    "abstract": "Email spoofing is a critical technique used in phishing attacks to impersonate a trusted sender. SMTP smuggling is a new vulnerability that allows adversaries to perform email spoofing while bypassing existing authentication protocols such as SPF and DMARC. While SMTP smuggling has been publicly disclosed since 2023, its impact has not been comprehensively evaluated and the effectiveness of the community's mitigation strategies is yet unknown. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of SMTP smuggling vulnerabilities, supported by empirical measurements of public email services, open-source email software, and email security gateways. More importantly, for the first time, we explored how to perform measurements on private email services ethically, with new methodologies combining user studies, a DKIM side channel, and a non-intrusive testing method. Collectively, we found that 19 public email services, 1,577 private email services, five open-source email software, and one email gateway were still vulnerable to SMTP smuggling (and/or our new variants). In addition, our results showed that the centralization of email infrastructures (e.g., shared SFP records, commonly used email software/gateways) has amplified the impact of SMTP smuggling. Adversaries can spoof highly reputable domains through free-to-register email accounts while bypassing sender authentication. We provided suggestions on short-term and long-term solutions to mitigate this threat. To further aid email administrators, we developed an online service to help self-diagnosis of SMTP smuggling vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "Human-subjects researchers are increasingly expected to de-identify and publish data about research participants. However, de-identification is difficult, lacking objective solutions for how to balance privacy and utility, and requiring significant time and expertise. To understand researchers' approaches, we interviewed 18 practitioners who have de-identified data for publication and 6 curators who review data submissions for repositories and funding organizations. We find that researchers account for the kinds of risks described by k-anonymity, but they address them through manual and social processes and not through systematic assessments of risk across a dataset. This allows for nuance but may leave published data vulnerable to re-identification. We explore why researchers take this approach and highlight three main barriers to more rigorous de-identification: threats seem unrealistic, stronger standards are not incentivized or supported, and tools do not meet researchers' needs. We conclude with takeaways for repositories, funding agencies, and privacy experts."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/so",
    "abstract": "Compared to the traditional desktop setting where web applications (apps) are live by nature, mobile apps are similar to binary programs that are installed on devices, in that they remain static until they are updated. However, they can also contain live, dynamic components if they interface with the web. This may lead to a confusing scenario, in which a mobile app itself has not been updated, but changes in dynamic components have caused changes in the overall app behavior.\nIn this work, we present the ï¬rst large-scale analysis of mobile app dependencies through a dual perspective accounting for time and version updates, with a focus on expired domains. First, we detail a methodology to build a representative corpus comprising 77,206 versions of 15,124 unique Android apps. Next, we extract the unique eTLD+1 domain dependencies â the \"DNS footprint\" â of each APK by monitoring the network trafï¬c produced with a dynamic, UI-guided test input generator and report on the footprint of a typical app. Using these footprints, combined with a methodology that deduces potential periods of vulnerability for individual APKs by leveraging passive DNS, we characterize how apps may have been affected by expired domains throughout time. Our ï¬ndings indicate that the threat of expired domains in app dependencies is nontrivial at scale, affecting hundreds of apps and thousands of APKs, occasionally affecting apps that rank within the top ten of their categories, apps that have hundreds of millions of downloads, or apps that were the latest version. Furthermore, we uncovered 41 immediately registrable domains that were found in app footprints during our analyses, and provide evidence in the form of case studies as to their potential for abuse. We also ï¬nd that even the most security-conscious users cannot protect themselves against the risk of their using an app that has an expired dependency, even if they can update their apps instantaneously."

    "abstract": "There is growing awareness that the analysis of personal data, such as individuals' mobility, financial, and health data, can provide significant benefits to society. However, liberal societies have so far refrained from such analytics, arguably due to the lack of secure analytics platforms that scale to billions of records while operating in a very strong threat model. We contend that one fundamental gap here is the lack of an architecture that can scale (actively-)secure multi-party computation (MPC) horizontally without weakening security. To bridge this gap, we present CoVault, an analytics platform that leverages server-aided MPC and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to colocate the MPC parties in a single datacenter without reducing security, and scales MPC horizontally to the datacenter's available resources. CoVault scales well empirically. For example, CoVault can scale the DualEx 2PC protocol to perform epidemic analytics for a country of 80M people (about 11.85B data records/day) on a continuous basis using one core pair for every 30,000 people."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of technologies like text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), detecting deepfake voices has become increasingly crucial. However, both academia and industry lack a comprehensive and intuitive benchmark for evaluating detectors. Existing datasets are limited in language diversity and lack many manipulations encountered in real-world production environments.\nTo fill this gap, we propose VoiceWukong, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of deepfake voice detectors. To build the dataset, we first collected deepfake voices generated by 19 advanced and widely recognized commercial tools and 15 open-source tools. We then created 38 data variants covering six types of manipulations, constructing the evaluation dataset for deepfake voice detection. VoiceWukong thus includes 265,200 English and 148,200 Chinese deepfake voice samples. Using VoiceWukong, we evaluated 12 state-of-the-art detectors. AASIST2 achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 13.50%, while all others exceeded 20%. Our findings reveal that these detectors face significant challenges in real-world applications, with dramatically declining performance. In addition, we conducted a user study with more than 300 participants. The results are compared with the performance of the 12 detectors and a multimodel large language model (MLLM), i.e., Qwen2-Audio, where different detectors and humans exhibit varying identification capabilities for deepfake voices at different deception levels, while the MLLM demonstrates no detection ability at all. Furthermore, we provide a leaderboard for deepfake voice detection, publicly available at https://voicewukong.github.io."

The rise of 3D printing technology introduces significant risks to public safety, enabling individuals with internet access and consumer-grade 3D printers to produce untraceable firearms, counterfeit products, and more. This growing threat calls for a better mechanism to track the production of 3D-printed parts.\nInspired by the success of fingerprinting on traditional 2D printers, we introduce SIDE (Secure Information EmbeDding and Extraction), a novel fingerprinting framework tailored for 3D printing. SIDE addresses the adversarial challenges of 3D print forensics by offering both secure information embedding and extraction. First, through novel coding-theoretic techniques, SIDE is both~break-resilient and~loss-tolerant, enabling fingerprint recovery even if the adversary breaks the print into fragments and conceals a portion of them. Second, SIDE further leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to secure the fingerprint embedding process."

    "abstract": "The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) enhances Internet routing security. RPKI are effective only when routers employ them to validate and filter invalid BGP announcements, a process known as Route Origin Validation (ROV). However, the partial deployment of ROV has led to the phenomenon of collateral damage, where even ROV-enabled ASes can inadvertently direct traffic to incorrect origins if subsequent hops fail to perform proper validation.\nIn this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to measure the extent of collateral damage in the real world. Our analysis reveals that a staggering 85.6% of RPKI-invalid announcements are vulnerable to collateral damage attacks and 34% of ROV-enabled ASes are still susceptible to collateral damage attacks. To address this critical issue, we introduce ImpROV, which detects and avoids next hops that are likely to cause collateral damage for a specific RPKI-invalid prefix; our approach operates without affecting other IP address spaces on the data plane that are not impacted by this collateral damage.\nOur extensive evaluations show that ImpROV can reduce the hijack success ratio for most ASes that deployed ROV, while only introduce less than 3% and 4% of Memory and CPU overhead."

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to neural networks, enabling adversaries to manipulate model outputs on specific inputs, often with devastating consequences, especially in critical applications. While backdoor attacks have been studied in various contexts, little attention has been given to their practicality and persistence in continual learning, particularly in understanding how the continual updates to model parameters, as new data distributions are learned and integrated, impact the effectiveness of these attacks over time.\nTo address this gap, we introduce two persistent backdoor attacksâBlind Task Backdoor and Latent Task Backdoorâeach leveraging minimal adversarial influence. Our blind task backdoor subtly alters the loss computation without direct control over the training process, while the latent task backdoor influences only a single task's training, with all other tasks trained benignly. We evaluate these attacks under various configurations, demonstrating their efficacy with static, dynamic, physical, and semantic triggers. Our results show that both attacks consistently achieve high success rates across different continual learning algorithms, while effectively evading state-of-the-art defenses, such as SentiNet and I-BAU."

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in authentication mechanisms, compromise of online accounts remains prevalent. Therefore, technologies to detect compromise retroactively are also necessary. Service providers try to help users diagnose the security status of their accounts via account security interfaces (ASIs) that display recent logins or other activity. Recent work showed how major services' ASIs are untrustworthy because they rely on easily manipulated client-provided values. The reason is a seemingly fundamental tension between accurately attributing accesses to particular devices and the need to prevent online services from tracking devices.\nWe propose client-side encrypted access logging (CSAL) as a new approach that navigates the tension between tracking privacy and ASI utility. The key idea is to add to account activity logs end-to-end (E2E) encrypted device identification information, leveraging OS support and FIDO2-style attestations. We detail a full proposal for a CSAL protocol that works alongside existing authentication mechanisms and provide a formal analysis of integrity, privacy, and unlinkability in the face of honest-but-curious adversaries. Interestingly, a key challenge is characterizing what is feasible in terms of logging in this setting. We discuss security against active adversaries, provide a proof-of-concept implementation, and overall show feasibility of how OS vendors and service providers can work together towards improved account security and user safety."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/onishi",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel electromagnetic (EM) side-channel attack that allows for acoustic eavesdropping on electronic devices. This method specifically targets modern digital microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones, which transmit captured audio via pulse-density modulation (PDM), that translate the analog sound signal into the density of output pulses in the digital domain. We discover that each harmonic of these digital pulses retains acoustic information, allowing the original audio to be retrieved through simple FM demodulation using standard radio receivers. An attacker can exploit this phenomenon to capture what the victim microphone hears remotely without installing malicious software or tampering with the device. We verify the vulnerability presence by conducting real-world evaluation on several PDM microphones and electronic devices, including laptops and smart speakers. For example, we demonstrate that the attack achieves up to 94.2% accuracy in recognizing spoken digits, up to 2 meters from a victim laptop located behind a 25 cm concrete wall. We also evaluate the attacker capability to eavesdrop on speech using popular speech-to-text APIs (e.g., OpenAI) not trained on EM traces, achieving a maximum of 14% transcription error rate in recovering the Harvard Sentences dataset. We further demonstrate that similar accuracy can be achieved with a cheap and stealthy antenna made out of copper tape. We finally discuss the limited effectiveness of current defenses such as resampling, and we propose a new hardware defense based on clock randomization."

    "abstract": "The expansion of capabilities in large-scale models often incurs prohibitively high training costs. Fortunately, recent advancements in model merging techniques have made it possible to efficiently combine multiple large models, each designed for a specific task, into a single multi-functional model with negligible cost. Despite these advantages, there is a notable research gap regarding the security implications of model merging, particularly concerning backdoor vulnerabilities. In this study, we introduce a novel supply chain threat under the model merging scenario: multiple ostensibly benign models can be merged into a backdoored model. To rigorously explore this threat, we propose MergeBackdoor, a versatile training framework designed to suppress backdoor behaviors in upstream models before merging, while simultaneously ensuring the emergence of the backdoor when these models are merged. Through extensive evaluations across 3 types of models (ViT, BERT, and LLM) and 12 datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MergeBackdoor, i.e., the attack success rates (ASRs) of the upstream models before merging are all at a random-guessing level, and the ASRs can reach nearly 1.0 for the final merged model. Besides conducting an in-depth analysis of MergeBackdoor's underlying mechanism, we further demonstrate that even the most knowledgeable detectors fail to identify the anomalies in these models before merging. We highlight that our findings underscore the critical need for security audit throughout the entire merging pipeline."

    "abstract": "In a single secret leader election (SSLE) protocol, all parties collectively and obliviously elect one leader. No one else should learn its identity unless it reveals itself as the leader. The problem is first formalized by Boneh et al. (AFT '20), which proposes an efficient construction based on the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. Considering the potential risk of quantum computers, several follow-ups focus on designing a post-quantum secure SSLE protocol based on pure lattices or fully homomorphic encryption. However, no concrete benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such heavy cryptographic primitives.\nIn this work, we present Qelect, the first practical constant-round post-quantum secure SSLE protocol. We first adapt the commitment scheme in Boneh et al. (AFT '23) into a multi-party randomizable commitment scheme, and propose our novel construction based on an adapted version of ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem. We then use it as a building block and construct a constant-round single secret leader election (crSSLE) scheme. We utilize the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) property of a specific threshold fully homomorphic encryption (tFHE) scheme to evaluate our election circuit efficiently. Finally, we built Qelect from the crSSLE scheme, with performance optimizations including a preprocessing phase to amortize the local computation runtime and a retroactive detection phase to avoid the heavy zero-knowledge proofs during the election phase. Qelect achieves asymptotic improvements and is concretely practical. We implemented a prototype of Qelect and evaluated its performance in a WAN. Qelect is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/song-mingyang",
    "abstract": "Fingerprinting techniques allow a database owner (DO) to embed unique identifiers within relational databases to trace unauthorized redistribution. To protect its interests, the DO often prioritizes maximizing fingerprint robustness, resulting in extensive modifications to the databases. However, excessive modifications may significantly degrade the databases' utility, making recipients hesitant to purchase databases that seem compromised when they cannot evaluate the maximum number of modified bits made during fingerprinting process. Current database fingerprinting techniques focus only on boosting fingerprint robustness, without providing recipients any mechanism to verify the degree of modifications. This paper, for the first time, addresses the research gap in providing recipients the ability to verify the maximum number of modified bits in database fingerprinting. We introduce a fuzzy perturbation verification (FPV) protocol, which enables a verifier to assess the extent of modifications made to a bit-string by a prover while keeping the exact modification positions and original bit-string confidential. Using the FPV protocol, we propose UtiliClear, a novel database fingerprinting scheme that allows the recipient to specify and verify the modification degree within the fingerprinted database. We theoretically validate that UtiliClear enables recipients to verify the extent of modifications during the fingerprinting process while maintaining fingerprint robustness, database utility, and data privacy. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate UtiliClear's performance using large real-world datasets. The experimental results and analysis indicate that UtiliClear incurs modest overhead while preserving fingerprint robustness and database utility comparable to existing state-of-the-art schemes."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/xiang",
    "abstract": "Auditing algorithms' privacy typically involves simulating a game-based protocol that determines which of two adjacent datasets was the original input. Traditional approaches require thousands of such simulations, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods propose single-run auditing of the target algorithm to address this, substantially reducing computational cost. However, these methods' general applicability and tightness in producing empirical privacy guarantees remain uncertain.\nThis work studies such problems in detail. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a unifying framework for privacy audits based on information-theoretic principles, modeling the audit as a bit transmission problem in a noisy channel. This formulation allows us to derive fundamental limits and develop an audit approach that yields tight privacy lower bounds for various DP protocols. Second, leveraging this framework, we demystify the method of privacy audit by one run, identifying the conditions under which single-run audits are feasible or infeasible. Our analysis provides general guidelines for conducting privacy audits and offers deeper insights into the privacy audit.\nFinally, through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces tighter privacy lower bounds on common differentially private mechanisms while requiring significantly fewer observations. We also provide a case study illustrating that our method successfully detects privacy violations in flawed implementations of private algorithms."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/daffalla",
    "abstract": "This paper is currently under embargo, but the paper abstract is available now. The final paper PDF will be available on the first day of the conference.The recent rollout of passkeys by hundreds of web services online is the largest attempt yet to achieve the goal of passwordless authentication. However, new authentication mechanisms can often overlook the unique threats faced by at-risk users, such as survivors of intimate partner violence, human trafficking, and elder abuse. Such users face interpersonal threats: adversaries who routinely have physical access to devices and either know or can compel disclosure of passwords or PINs. The extent to which passkeys enable or mitigate such interpersonal threats has not yet been explored. We perform the first analysis of passkeys in interpersonal threat models. To do so, we introduce an abusability analysis framework to help practitioners and researchers identify ways in which new features can be exploited in interpersonal threat models. We then apply our framework to the setting of passkeys, ultimately investigating 19 passkey-supporting services. We identify a variety of abuse vectors that allow adversaries to use passkeys to cause harm in interpersonal settings. In the most egregious cases, flawed implementations of major passkey-supporting services allow ongoing illicit adversarial access with no way for a victim to restore security of their account. We also discover abuse vectors that prevent users from accessing their accounts or that help attackers emotionally manipulate (gaslight) users."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/spracklen",
    "abstract": "The reliance of popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript on centralized package repositories and open-source software, combined with the emergence of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), has created a new type of threat to the software supply chain: package hallucinations. These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/jin-weifei",
    "abstract": "The widespread application of automatic speech recognition (ASR) supports large-scale voice surveillance, raising concerns about privacy among users. In this paper, we concentrate on using adversarial examples to mitigate unauthorized disclosure of speech privacy thwarted by potential eavesdroppers in speech communications. While audio adversarial examples have demonstrated the capability to mislead ASR models or evade ASR surveillance, they are typically constructed through time-intensive offline optimization, restricting their practicality in real-time voice communication. Recent work overcame this limitation by generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and enhancing their transferability for black-box scenarios. However, they introduced excessive noise that significantly degrades audio quality and affects human perception, thereby limiting their effectiveness in practical scenarios. To address this limitation and protect live users' speech against ASR systems, we propose a novel framework, AudioShield. Central to this framework is the concept of Transferable Universal Adversarial Perturbations in the Latent Space (LS-TUAP). By transferring the perturbations to the latent space, the audio quality is preserved to a large extent. Additionally, we propose target feature adaptation to enhance the transferability of UAPs by embedding target text features into the perturbations. Comprehensive evaluation on four commercial ASR APIs (Google, Amazon, iFlytek, and Alibaba), three widely-used voice assistants, two LLM-powered ASR and one NN-based ASR demonstrates the protection superiority of AudioShield over existing competitors, and both objective and subjective evaluations indicate that AudioShield significantly improves the audio quality. Moreover, AudioShield also shows high effectiveness in the real-time end-to-end scenarios, and demonstrates strong resilience against adaptive countermeasures."

    "abstract": "We investigate the specific design and implementation of safety guardrails in black-box text-to-image (T2I) models, such as DALLÂ·E, which are implemented to prevent potential misuse from generating harmful image content. Specifically, we introduce a novel timing-based side-channel analysis approach to reverse engineer the safety mechanisms of DALLÂ·E models. By measuring and analyzing the differential response times of these systems, we reverse-engineer the architecture of previously unknown cascading safety filters at various stages of the T2I pipeline. Our analysis reveals key takeaways by contrasting safety mechanisms in DALLÂ·E 2 and DALLÂ·E 3: DALLÂ·E 2 uses blocklist-based filtering, whereas DALLÂ·E 3 employs an LLM-based prompt revision stage to improve image quality and filter harmful content. We find discrepancies between the LLM's language understanding and the CLIP embedding used for image generation, which we exploit to develop a negation-based jailbreaking attack. We further uncover gaps in the multilingual coverage of safety measures, which render DALLÂ·E 3 vulnerable to a new class of low-resource language attacks for T2I systems. Lastly, we outline six distinct countermeasures techniques and research directions to address our findings. This work emphasizes the challenges of aligning the diverse components of these systems and underscores the need to improve the consistency and robustness of guardrails across the entire T2I pipeline."

    "abstract": "We present Shechi, an easy-to-use programming framework for secure high-performance computing on distributed datasets. Shechi automatically converts Pythonic code into a secure distributed equivalent using multiparty homomorphic encryption (MHE), combining homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multiparty computation (SMC) techniques to enable efficient distributed computation. Shechi abstracts away considerations about the private and distributed aspects of the input data from end users through a familiar Pythonic syntax. Our framework introduces new data types for the efficient handling of distributed data as well as systematic compiler optimizations for cryptographic and distributed computations. We evaluate Shechi on a wide range of applications, including principal component analysis and complex genomic analysis tasks. Our results demonstrate Shechi's ability to uncover optimizations missed even by expert developers, achieving up to 15Ã runtime improvements over the prior state-of-the-art solutions and a 40-fold improvement in overall code expressiveness compared to manually optimized code. Shechi represents the first MHE compiler, extending secure computation frameworks to the analysis of sensitive distributed datasets."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zhang-bosi",
    "abstract": "Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an extensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on reactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened, e.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot mitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of attackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack stage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner, we can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in this work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers. Specifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price manipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it conducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and transaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow dependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For scalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts inter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint attacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation results illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines with 91.6% recall and â¼100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616 attack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for $9.25M financial losses, with only 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after the corresponding deployment on average. These attacks have already led to $641K financial losses, and seven of them are still waiting for their ripe time."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/tibaldo",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose GNSS-WASP, a novel wide-area spoofing attack carried by a constellation of strategically-located synchronized transmitters. Unlike known attacks, which are constrained by the attacker's ability to track victim receivers, GNSS-WASP manipulates the positions measured by all the receivers in a target area without knowing the victim's positions. This allows GNSS-WASP to spoof a swarm of victims to another location while preserving their true formation (i.e., their relative distances). This opens the possibility of advanced attacks that divert entire fleets of vehicles and drones in a large area without the need to track specific victims. As such, GNSS-WASP bypasses state-of-the-art spoofing countermeasures that rely on constellations of receivers with known distances and those that rely on sudden, unpredictable movements for spoofing detection. While previous works discuss the stringent requirements for perfect spoofing of multiple receivers at known fixed locations, GNSS-WASP demonstrates how to spoof any number of moving receivers at unknown positions in a large area with an error that can remain hidden behind the legitimate noise. In addition to extensive simulations, we implement a prototype of GNSS-WASP with off-the-shelf software-defined radios and evaluate it on real GNSS receivers. Despite the error introduced by the proposed attack, GNSS-WASP can successfully spoof two receivers while maintaining their relative distance with an average error of 0.97 m for locations 1000 m away from the reference position. Finally, we also highlight possible countermeasures."

    "abstract": "OPC UA is a standardized Industrial Control System (ICS) protocol, deployed in critical infrastructures, that aims to ensure security. The forthcoming version 1.05 includes major changes in the underlying cryptographic design, including a Diffie-Hellmann based key exchange, as opposed to the previous RSA based version. Version 1.05 is supposed to offer stronger security, including Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). \nWe perform a formal security analysis of the security protocols specified in OPC UA v1.05 and v1.04, for the RSA-based and the new DH-based mode, using the state-of-the-art symbolic protocol verifier ProVerif. Compared to previous studies, our model is much more comprehensive, including the new protocol version, combination of the different sub-protocols for establishing secure channels, sessions and their management, covering a large range of possible configurations. This results in one of the largest models ever studied in ProVerif raising many challenges related to its verification mainly due to the complexity of the state machine. We discuss how we mitigated this complexity to obtain meaningful analysis results. Our analysis uncovered several new vulnerabilities, that have been reported to and acknowledged by the OPC Foundation. We designed and proposed provably secure fixes, most of which are included in the upcoming version of the standard."

    "abstract": "Generative AI technology has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, offering powerful capabilities to enhance productivity. However, these same capabilities can be exploited by adversaries for malicious purposes. While existing research on adversarial applications of generative AI predominantly focuses on cyberattacks, less attention has been given to attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the use of generative AI for facilitating model-related attacks, including model extraction, membership inference, and model inversion. Our study reveals that adversaries can launch a variety of model-related attacks against both image and text models in a data-free and black-box manner, achieving comparable performance to baseline methods that have access to the target models' training data and parameters in a white-box manner. This research serves as an important early warning to the community about the potential risks associated with generative AI-powered attacks on deep learning models.

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/ye-duplication",
    "abstract": "Duplication is a prevalent issue within datasets. Existing research has demonstrated that the presence of duplicated data in training datasets can significantly influence both model performance and data privacy. However, the impact of data duplication on the unlearning process remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by pioneering a comprehensive investigation into the role of data duplication, not only in standard machine unlearning but also in federated and reinforcement unlearning paradigms. Specifically, we propose an adversary who duplicates a subset of the target model's training set and incorporates it into the training set. After training, the adversary requests the model owner to unlearn this duplicated subset, and analyzes the impact on the unlearned model. For example, the adversary can challenge the model owner by revealing that, despite efforts to unlearn it, the influence of the duplicated subset remains in the model. Moreover, to circumvent detection by de-duplication techniques, we propose three novel near-duplication methods for the adversary, each tailored to a specific unlearning paradigm. We then examine their impacts on the unlearning process when de-duplication techniques are applied. Our findings reveal several crucial insights: 1) the gold standard unlearning method, retraining from scratch, fails to effectively conduct unlearning under certain conditions; 2) unlearning duplicated data can lead to significant model degradation in specific scenarios; and 3) meticulously crafted duplicates can evade detection by de-duplication methods.

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/xiao",
    "abstract": "Currently, greybox fuzzing is a crucial technique for identifying software bugs. However, applying greybox fuzzing to Commercial-Off-the-Shelf ( COTS ) binaries is still a difficult task because gathering code coverage data is challenging. Existing methods for collecting code coverage in COTS binaries often lead to program crashes, notable performance reductions, and limited compatibility with various hardware platforms. As a result, none of the current approaches can effectively handle all COTS binaries.\nThis paper introduces a new feedback mechanism called system call pattern coverage, which is designed to support binaries that cannot be handled by existing approaches. Unlike other methods, system call pattern coverage does not involve rewriting binaries, using emulators, or relying on hardware such as Intel-PT. As a result, it enables fuzzing of binaries without the risk of breaking target applications, slow performance, or the need for specific hardware. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism, we developed fuzzers called SPFuzz and SPFuzz++ and conducted an evaluation using 29 real-world benchmarks. The results of our evaluation show that SPFuzz and SPFuzz++ perform comparably to conventional code coverage guidance and are capable of identifying new bugs even without access to the source code. In fact, we discovered six new CVEs in commercial applications like CUDA using SPFuzz."

    "abstract": "Existing usable security and privacy research remains skewed toward WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies, whereas studies on non-WEIRD societies are scarce and mostly qualitative. The lack of large-scale cross-country comparisons makes it difficult to understand how people's security needs, perceptions, and practices vary across contexts and cultures. To fill this gap, we surveyed participants (N=12,351) from 12 countries across four continents â with seven WEIRD and five non-WEIRD countries â to examine participants' perceptions (e.g., regarding importance of different data types and risks posed by possible attackers) and practices (e.g., adoption of protective measures and prior negative experiences). We found significant differences between WEIRD versus non-WEIRD countries across almost all variables, with varying effect sizes. For instance, participants from non-WEIRD countries relied more on friends and family for advice on digital security than their WEIRD counterparts, but they also viewed friends and family as more likely attackers. We provide our interpretations of the cross-country differences, discuss how our findings inform security interventions and education, and summarize lessons learned from conducting cross-country research."

    "abstract": "This work proposes an encrypted hybrid database framework that combines vectorized data search and relational data query over quantized fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). We observe that, due to the lack of efficient encrypted data ordering capabilities, most existing encrypted database (EDB) frameworks do not support hybrid queries involving both vectorized and relational data. To further enrich query expressiveness while retaining evaluation efficiency, we propose Engorgio, a hybrid EDB framework based on quantized data ordering techniques over FHE. Specifically, we design a new quantized data encoding scheme along with a set of novel comparison and permutation algorithms to accurately generate and apply orders between large-precision data items. Furthermore, we optimize specific query types, including full table scan, batched query, and Top-k query to enhance the practical performance of the proposed framework. In the experiment, we show that, compared to the state-of-the-art EDB frameworks, Engorgio is up to 28xâ854x faster in homomorphic comparison, 65xâ687x faster in homomorphic sorting and 15xâ1,640x faster over a variety of end-to-end relational, vectorized, and hybrid SQL benchmarks. Using Engorgio, the amortized runtime for executing a relational and hybrid query on a 48-core processor is under 3 and 75 seconds, respectively, over a 10K-row hybrid database."

In simulations, Shadow Hack achieves a 100% attack success rate at distances between 11m and 21m across multiple models. Our physical world experiments validate these findings, demonstrating up to 100% success rate at 10m against PointPillars and 98% against SECOND-IoU, using mirror sheets that achieve nearly 100% point cloud removal rate at distances from 1 to 14 meters.

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/russinovich",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as \"jailbreaks'', seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models."

    "abstract": "Multi-party private set union (MPSU) protocol enables m (m > 2) parties, each holding a set, to collectively compute the union of their sets without revealing any additional information to other parties. There are two main categories of multi-party private set union (MPSU) protocols: The first category builds on public-key techniques, where existing works require a super-linear number of public-key operations, resulting in their poor practical efficiency. The second category builds on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques. The only work in this category, proposed by Liu and Gao (ASIACRYPT 2023), features the best concrete performance among all existing protocols, but still has super-linear computation and communication. Moreover, it does not achieve the standard semi-honest security, as it inherently relies on a non-collusion assumption, which is unlikely to hold in practice.\nThere remain two significant open problems so far: no MPSU protocol achieves semi-honest security based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques, and no MPSU protocol achieves both linear computation and linear communication complexity. In this work, we resolve both of them.\n\nWe propose the first MPSU protocol based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques in the standard semi-honest model. This protocol is 3.9-10.0 x faster than Liu and Gao in the LAN setting. Concretely, our protocol requires only 4.4 seconds in online phase for 3 parties with sets of 2^20 items each.\nWe propose the first MPSU protocol achieving both linear computation and linear communication complexity, based on public-key operations. This protocol has the lowest overall communication costs and shows a factor of 3.0-36.5x improvement in terms of overall communication compared to Liu and Gao.\n\nWe implement our protocols and conduct an extensive experiment to compare the performance of our protocols and the state-of-the-art. To the best of our knowledge, our code is the first correct and secure implementation of MPSU that reports on large-size experiments."

EMVCo publishes a 15 book specification that these companies use to operate together. However, many of these parties have independently added additional features, such as Square restricting offline readers to phone transactions only, Apple, Google and Samsung implementing transit modes and Visa and Mastercard complying with regional regulations on high value contactless payments. We investigate these features, and find that these parties have been independently retrofitting and overloading the core EMV specification. Subtle interactions and mismatches between the different companies' additions lead to a range of vulnerabilities, making it possible to bypass restrictions to smartphone only payments, make unauthenticated high value transactions offline, and use a cloned card to make a Â£25000 transaction offline. To find fixes, we build formal models of the EMV protocol with the new features we investigated and test different possible solutions.

    "abstract": "This work presents Deepfold, a novel multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) based on Reed-Solomon code that offers optimal prover time and a more concise proof size. For the first time, Deepfold adapts the FRI-based multilinear PCS to the list decoding radius setting, requiring significantly fewer query repetitions and thereby achieving a 3x reduction in proof size compared to Basefold (Crypto '24), while preserving its advantages in prover time. Compared with PolyFRIM (USENIX Security '24), Deepfold achieves a 2x improvement in prover time, verifier time, and proof size. Another contribution of this work is a batch evaluation scheme, which enables the FRI-based multilinear PCS to handle polynomials whose size is not a power of two more efficiently.\nOur scheme has broad applications in zk-SNARKs, since PCS is a key component in modern zk-SNARK constructions. For example, when replacing the PCS component of Virgo (S&P '20) with Deepfold, our scheme achieves a 2.5x faster prover time when proving the knowledge of a Merkle tree with 256 leaves, while maintaining the similar proof size. When replacing the PCS component of HyperPlonk (Eurocrypt '23) with Deepfold, our scheme has about 3.6x faster prover time. Additionally, when applying our arbitrary length input commitment to verifiable matrix multiplications for matrices of size 1200x768 and 768x2304, which are actual use cases in GPT-2 model, the performance showcases a 2.4x reduction in prover time compared to previous approaches."

However, traditional honeypots often fail to effectively deceive attackers due to their inability to emulate the physical and network dependencies present in real-world IoT environments. Consequently, attackers can easily detect inconsistencies among the honeypots after launching attacks from multiple sources, spanning both cyber and physical domains, to verify device status. To address this challenge, we propose a Cyber-Physical Deception System (CPDS) capable of mimicking the intricate cyber-physical connections among IoT devices by coordinating various IoT honeypots. Specifically, we model the vulnerabilities of individual IoT devices by collecting and analyzing attack traces. We analyze the physical and network dependencies among IoT devices and formulate them as Prolog rules. Then, we coordinate the honeypots based on the attacker's actions and the dependency rules, ensuring cross-layer consistency among the honeypots. We implemented our deception system by leveraging software-defined networking, enhancing existing IoT honeypots, and configuring them to work in concert. Through online deployment, human evaluation on real attack scenario and extensive simulation experiments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of CPDS in terms of fidelity and scalability."

    "abstract": "Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks have long been a major threat to the availability of the World Wide Web. While prior works have extensively studied network-layer DoS and certain types of application-layer DoS, such as Regular Expression DoS (ReDoS), little attention has been paid to memory exhaustion DoS, especially in Java Web containers. Our research target is a special type of memory exhaustion DoS vulnerabilities that retain user data in web containers, which is defined as Data Retention DoS (DRDoS) in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic academic studies of such DRDoS vulnerabilities of Java Web Containers except for a few manually found vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.\nIn this paper, we design and implement a novel static analysis approach, called DR. D, to detect and assess DRDoS vulnerabilities in Java web containers. Our key insight is to analyze the request handling process of web containers and detect whether client-controlled request data may be retained in the containers, thus leading to DRDoS vulnerabilities. We apply DR. D on four popular open-source Java web containers, discovering that all of them have DRDoS vulnerabilities. Specifically, DR. D finds 25 zero-day, exploitable vulnerabilities. We have responsibly reported all of them to corresponding developers and received confirmations. So far, we have received seventeen CVE identifiers (three of them assigned with high severity). Based on scan results from search engine, e.g., Shodan, we identify that over 1.5 million public IP addresses are hosting vulnerable versions of Java web containers potentially with DRDoS found by DR. D, demonstrating the spread of DRDoS vulnerability."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/bajo",
    "abstract": "Code reuse attacks exploit legitimate code sequences in a binary to execute malicious actions without introducing new code. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) defenses mitigate these attacks by restricting program execution to valid code paths. However, new programming paradigms, like C++20 coroutines, expose gaps in current CFI protections. We demonstrate that, despite rigorous standardization, C++ coroutines present new vulnerabilities that undermine both coarse-grained and fine-grained CFI defenses. Coroutines, widely used in asynchronous programming, store critical execution data in writable heap memory, making them susceptible to exploitation. This paper introduces Coroutine Frame-Oriented Programming (CFOP), a novel code reuse attack that leverages these vulnerabilities across major compilers. We demonstrate how CFOP allows attackers to hijack program execution and manipulate data in CFI-protected environments. Through a series of Proof of Concept (PoC) exploits, we show the practical impact of CFOP. We also propose defensive measures to enhance coroutine security and address this emerging threat."

    "abstract": "Rowhammer attacks are pervasive in client systems when launched natively. The biggest Rowhammer threat for such systems, however, lies in the browser. Our large-scale evaluation of browser-based Rowhammer attacks shows that they can only trigger bit flips on a small fraction of DRAM devices. Postponing refresh commands that trigger in-DRAM mitigations can boost the performance of Rowhammer attacks, but it has never been demonstrated in practice. \nWe introduce Posthammer, a new Rowhammer attack in JavaScript that forces the CPU's memory controller to postpone refresh commands by creating long durations of intense Rowhammer activity followed by sufficiently long delay windows to allow the memory controller to batch refresh commands. Posthammer features a new abstraction called lane, which enables a subset of addresses in a Rowhammer pattern to be accessed more often. Lanes enable Posthammer to support effective refresh-postponed non-uniform patterns in the browser for the first time. Our evaluation shows that Posthammer is 2.8Ã more effective than the state of the art, triggering bit flips on 86% of our 28 DDR4 test devices."

    "abstract": "Steganography is a technique to transmit secret messages over a public channel so that the very existence of these secret messages can not be detected. In this field, provably secure steganography based on shared white-box samplers is a major focus due to its capability to construct secure and efficient steganographic systems on various practical channels. However, designing a novel provably secure steganography scheme remains challenging, since the scheme must maintain a nearly identical sampling distribution to any given discrete distribution while embedding secret information. Currently, there are only a few provably secure steganography schemes available, which significantly limits both practical application and theoretical research. In this paper, we propose a framework for designing provably secure steganography, with the universal security proof for schemes derived from this framework. This framework decomposes the overall complex design into three sub-processes that can be relatively easily achieved, namely Probability Recombination Module, Bin Sampling and Uniform Steganography Module. With this framework, we present several new provably secure steganography schemes and demonstrate that the recent work, Discop(base), is also encompassed by this framework. Additionally, guided by this framework, we have identified several schemes that are theoretically optimal or very effective under specified metrics and validated their effectiveness through experimental verification."

    "abstract": "DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack on the web that exploits naming collisions between DOM elements and JavaScript variables for malicious consequences such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS). An important step of DOM clobbering is the usage of \"gadgets\", which are code snippets in existing JavaScript libraries that allow attacker-injected, scriptless HTML markups to flow to sinks. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one prior work on detecting DOM clobbering gadgets. However, it adopts a set of predefined HTML payloads, which fail to discover DOM clobbering gadgets with complex constraints that have never been seen before.\nIn this paper, we present Hulk, the first dynamic analysis framework to automatically detect and exploit DOM Clobbering gadgets. Our key insight is to model attacker-controlled HTML markups as Symbolic DOMâa formalized representation to define and solve DOM-related constraints within the gadgetsâso that it can be used to generate exploit HTML markups. Our evaluation of Hulk against Tranco Top 5,000 sites discovered 497 exploitable DOM Clobbering gadgets that were not, and cannot be, identified by prior work. Examples of our findings include popular client-side libraries, such as Webpack and the Google API client library, both of which have acknowledged and patched the vulnerability. We further evaluate the impact of our newly-found, zero-day gadgets through successful end-to-end exploitation against widely-used web applications, including Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab and Canvas LMS, with 19 CVE identifiers being assigned so far."

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an adversary aims to determine whether a specific sample was part of the model's training data. Traditional MIAs exploit differences in the model's output posteriors, but in more challenging scenarios (label-only scenarios) where only predicted labels are available, existing works directly utilize the shortest distance of samples reaching decision boundaries as membership signals, denoted as the shortestBD. However, they face two key challenges: low distinguishability between members and non-members due to sample diversity, and high query requirements stemming from direction diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel label-only attack called DHAttack, designed for Higher performance and Higher stealth, focusing on the boundary distance of individual samples to mitigate the effects of sample diversity, and measuring this distance toward a fixed point to minimize query overhead. Empirical results demonstrate that DHAttack consistently outperforms other advanced attack methods. Notably, in some cases, DHAttack achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement over all baselines in terms of TPR @ 0.1% FPR with just 5 to 30 queries. Furthermore, we explore the reasons for DHAttack's success, and then analyze other crucial factors in the attack performance. Finally, we evaluate several defense mechanisms against DHAttack and demonstrate its superiority over all baseline attacks."

The charging communication of CCS is defined by the ISO 15118 standards, which have been improved over the years. Most notably, in 2014, important security features such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and usability enhancements such as Plug and Charge were introduced.\nIn this paper, we conduct the first measurement study of publicly deployed CCS DC charging stations to capture the state of deployment for different protocol versions and to better understand the attack surface of the EV charging infrastructure. In our evaluation, we examine 325 chargers manufactured between April 2013 and June 2023, and installed as late as May 2024 by 26 manufacturers across 4 European countries. We find that only 12% of the charging stations we analyzed implement TLS at all, leaving all others vulnerable to attacks that have already been demonstrated many years ago. We observe an increasing trend in support for ISO 15118-2 over the years, reaching 70% of chargers manufactured in 2023. We further notice that most chargers use a decade-old firmware for their HomePlug modems, which could contain vulnerabilities that have been patched since. Finally, we discuss design flaws with the Public Key Infrastructure system used in EV charging, and propose changes to improve the adoption and availability of TLS."

    "abstract": "Law enforcement and private-sector partners have in recent years conducted various interventions to disrupt the DDoS-for-hire market. Drawing on multiple quantitative datasets, including web traffic and ground-truth visits to seized websites, millions of DDoS attack records from academic, industry, and self-reported statistics, along with chats on underground forums and Telegram channels, we assess the effects of an ongoing global intervention against DDoS-for-hire services since December 2022. This is the most extensive booter takedown to date conducted, combining targeting infrastructure with digital influence tactics in a concerted effort by law enforcement across several countries with two waves of website takedowns and the use of deceptive domains. We found over half of the seized sites in the first wave returned within a median of one day, while all booters seized in the second wave returned within a median of two days. Re-emerged booter domains, despite closely resembling old ones, struggled to attract visitors (80â90% traffic reduction). While the first wave cut the global DDoS attack volume by 20â40% with a statistically significant effect specifically on UDP-based DDoS attacks (commonly attributed to booters), the impact of the second wave appeared minimal. Underground discussions indicated a cumulative impact, leading to changes in user perceptions of safety and causing some operators to leave the market. Despite the extensive intervention efforts, all DDoS datasets consistently suggest that the illicit market is fairly resilient, with an overall short-lived effect on the global DDoS attack volume lasting for at most only around six weeks."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, generated impersonation posts where 93.9% of them were deemed authentic, and boosted click rate of phishing links in spear phishing emails by 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised increasing concerns about their misuse in generating hate speech. Among all the efforts to address this issue, hate speech detectors play a crucial role. However, the effectiveness of different detectors against LLM-generated hate speech remains largely unknown. In this paper, we propose HateBench, a framework for benchmarking hate speech detectors on LLM-generated hate speech. We first construct a hate speech dataset of 7,838 samples generated by six widely-used LLMs covering 34 identity groups, with meticulous annotations by three labelers. We then assess the effectiveness of eight representative hate speech detectors on the LLM-generated dataset. Our results show that while detectors are generally effective in identifying LLM-generated hate speech, their performance degrades with newer versions of LLMs. We also reveal the potential of LLM-driven hate campaigns, a new threat that LLMs bring to the field of hate speech detection. By leveraging advanced techniques like adversarial attacks and model stealing attacks, the adversary can intentionally evade the detector and automate hate campaigns online. The most potent adversarial attack achieves an attack success rate of 0.966, and its attack efficiency can be further improved by 13-21x through model stealing attacks with acceptable attack performance. We hope our study can serve as a call to action for the research community and platform moderators to fortify defenses against these emerging threats."

The final paper PDF will be available on the first day of the conference.JuiceJacking is an attack in which malicious chargers compromise connected mobile devices. Shortly after the attack was discovered about a decade ago, mobile OSs introduced user prompts for confirming data connections from a USB host to a mobile device. Since the introduction of this countermeasure, no new USB-based attacks with comparable impact have been found.\nIn this paper, we present a novel family of USB-based attacks on mobile devices, ChoiceJacking, which is the first to bypass existing JuiceJacking mitigations. We observe that these mitigations assume that an attacker cannot inject input events while establishing a data connection. However, we show that this assumption does not hold in practice. We present a platform-agnostic attack principle and three concrete attack techniques for Android and iOS that allow a malicious charger to autonomously spoof user input to enable its own data connection. Our evaluation using a custom cheap malicious charger design reveals an alarming state of USB security on mobile platforms. Despite vendor customizations in USB stacks, ChoiceJacking attacks gain access to sensitive user files (pictures, documents, app data) on all tested devices from 8 vendors including the top 6 by market share. For two vendors, our attacks allow file extraction from locked devices. For stealthily performing attacks that require an unlocked device, we use a power line side-channel to detect suitable moments, i.e., when the user does not notice visual artifacts.\nWe responsibly disclosed all findings to affected vendors. All but one (including Google, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Apple) acknowledged our attacks and are in the process of integrating mitigations."

    "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) lead to proofs that can be succinctly verified but require huge computational resources to generate. Prior systems outsource proof generation either through public delegation, which reveals the witness to the third party, or, more preferably, private delegation that keeps the witness hidden using multiparty computation (MPC). However, current private delegation schemes struggle with scalability and efficiency due to MPC inefficiencies, poor resource utilization, and suboptimal design of zkSNARK protocols.\nIn this paper, we introduce DFS, a new zkSNARK that is delegation-friendly for both public and private scenarios. Prior work focused on optimizing the MPC protocols for existing zkSNARKs, while DFS uses co-design between MPC and zkSNARK so that the protocol is efficient for both distributed computing and MPC. In particular, DFS achieves linear prover time and logarithmic verification cost in the non-delegated setting. For private delegation, DFS introduces a scheme with zero communication overhead in MPC and achieves malicious security for free, which results in logarithmic overall communication; while prior work required linear communication. Our evaluation shows that DFS is as efficient as state-of-the-art zkSNARKs in public delegation; when used for private delegation, it scales better than previous work. In particular, for 2^24 constraints, the total communication of DFS is less than 500KB, while prior work incurs 300GB, which is linear to the circuit size. Additionally, we identify and address a security flaw in prior work, EOS (USENIX'23)."

UPI enables people to make quick everyday transactions and recurring payments, including rent, gas, and electricity, using the same app. The widespread adoption of UPI has sparked significant concerns regarding users' security and privacy, especially due to an alarming number of UPI-related scams and fraudulent transactions. While prior work has explored the technical security of UPI, to address security threats effectively, we must understand user mental models, concerns, security information sources, and behaviors. In a mixed-methods study of 26 semi-structured interviews with UPI users from India and content analysis of 16 security information sources from regulatory bodies, UPI apps, and banks offering UPI, we explore user mental models, concerns, where and how they receive security advice, as well as their security-relevant behaviors. We provide an analysis of users' concerns and threats around UPI security and privacy and highlight gaps where official advice falls short. Further, we recommend UPI providers and banks to curate accessible and useful advice to better alleviate users' concerns, and increase their reach.

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) technologies become more prevalent in privacy-sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, eventually incorporating sensitive information in building data-driven algorithms, it is vital to scrutinize whether these data face any privacy leakage risks. One potential threat arises from an adversary querying trained models using the public, non-sensitive attributes of entities in the training data to infer their private, sensitive attributes, a technique known as the attribute inference attack. This attack is particularly deceptive because, while it may perform poorly in predicting sensitive attributes across the entire dataset, it excels at predicting the sensitive attributes of records from a few vulnerable groups, a phenomenon known as disparate vulnerability. This paper illustrates that an adversary can take advantage of this disparity to carry out a series of new attacks, showcasing a threat level beyond previous imagination. We first develop a novel inference attack called the disparity inference attack, which targets the identification of high-risk groups within the dataset. We then introduce two targeted variations of the attribute inference attack that can identify and exploit a vulnerable subset of the training data, marking the first instances of targeted attacks in this category, achieving significantly higher accuracy than untargeted versions. We are also the first to introduce a novel and effective disparity mitigation technique that simultaneously preserves model performance and prevents any risk of targeted attacks."

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) serves as a powerful technique for proving the correctness of computations and has attracted significant interest from researchers. Numerous concrete schemes and implementations have been proposed in academia and industry. Unfortunately, the inherent complexity of zk-SNARK has created gaps between researchers, developers and users, as they focus differently on this technique. For example, researchers are dedicated to constructing new efficient proving systems with stronger security and new properties. At the same time, developers and users care more about the implementation's toolchains, usability and compatibility. This gap has hindered the development of zk-SNARK field.\nIn this work, we provide a comprehensive study of zk-SNARK, from theory to practice, pinpointing gaps and limitations. We first present a master recipe that unifies the main steps in converting a program into a zk-SNARK. We then classify existing zk-SNARKs according to their key techniques. Our classification addresses the main difference in practically valuable properties between existing zk-SNARK schemes. We survey over 40 zk-SNARKs since 2013 and provide a reference table listing their categories and properties. Following the steps in master recipe, we then survey 11 general-purpose popular used libraries. We elaborate on these libraries' usability, compatibility, efficiency and limitations. Since installing and executing these zk-SNARK systems is challenging, we also provide a completely virtual environment in which to run the compiler for each of them. We identify that the proving system is the primary focus in cryptography academia. In contrast, the constraint system presents a bottleneck in industry. To bridge this gap, we offer recommendations and advocate for the open-source community to enhance documentation, standardization and compatibility."

    "abstract": "Speech translation, which converts a spoken language into another spoken or written language, has experienced rapid advance recently. However, the security in this domain remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a novel security threat unique to speech translation systems, which is dubbed \"untranslation attack\". We observe that state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, despite their strong translation capabilities, exhibit an inherent tendency to output the content in the source speech language rather than the desired target language. Leveraging this phenomenon, we propose an attack model that deceives the system into outputting the source language content instead of translating it. Interestingly, we find that this approach achieves significant attack effectiveness with minimal overhead compared to traditional semantic perturbation attacks: it achieves a high attack success rate of 87.5% with a perturbation budget of as low as 0.001. Furthermore, we extend this approach to develop a universal perturbation attack, successfully testing it in the physical world."

    "abstract": "Thanks to their remarkable denoising capabilities, diffusion models are increasingly being employed as defensive tools to reinforce the robustness of other models, notably in purifying adversarial examples and certifying adversarial robustness. However, the potential risks of these practices remain largely unexplored, which is highly concerning. To bridge this gap, this work investigates the vulnerability of robustness-enhancing diffusion models.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that these models are highly susceptible to DIFF2, a simple yet effective attack, which substantially diminishes their robustness assurance. Essentially, DIFF2 integrates a malicious diffusion-sampling process into the diffusion model, guiding inputs embedded with specific triggers toward an adversary-defined distribution while preserving the normal functionality for clean inputs. Our case studies on adversarial purification and robustness certification show that DIFF2 can significantly reduce both post-purification and certified accuracy across benchmark datasets and models, highlighting the potential risks of relying on pre-trained diffusion models as defensive tools. We further explore possible countermeasures, suggesting promising avenues for future research."

We define a formal model of a fragment of p-code in propositional logic, enabling analysis by automated reasoning algorithms. We then synthesize code-reuse attacks by identifying selections of gadgets that can emulate a given p-code reference program. This enables our method to scale well, in both reference program and gadget library size, and facilitates integration with external tools. Our method matches or exceeds the success rate of state-of-the-art ROP chain synthesis methods while providing improved runtime performance."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chen-hung-mao",
    "abstract": "Rust supports type conversions and safe Rust guarantees the security of these conversions through robust static type checking and strict ownership guidelines. However, there are instances where programmers need to use unsafe Rust for certain type conversions, especially those involving pointers. Consequently, these conversions may cause severe memory corruption problems. Despite extensive research on type confusion bugs in C/C++, studies on type confusion bugs in Rust are still lacking. Also, due to Rust's new features in the type system, existing solutions in C/C++ cannot be directly applied to Rust. In this paper, we develop a static analysis tool called TYPEPULSE to detect three main categories of type confusion bugs in Rust including misalignment, inconsistent layout, and mismatched scope. TYPEPULSE first performs a type conversion analysis to collect and determine trait bounds for type pairs. Moreover, it performs a pointer alias analysis to resolve the alias relationship of pointers. Following the integration of information into the property graph, it constructs type patterns and detects each type of bug in various conversion scenarios. We run TYPEPULSE on the top 3,000 Rust packages and uncover 71 new type confusion bugs, exceeding the total number of type confusion bugs reported in RUSTSEC over the past five years. We have received 32 confirmations from developers, along with one CVE ID and six RUSTSEC IDs."

    "abstract": "Existing efforts in software protection have mostly focused on how to detect violations of confidentiality or integrity, with the goal of safeguarding information or ensuring the correctness of execution. Little has been done to study the handling of such violations, where the common practice is to crash the program. However, such strategies sacrifice availability, which is not acceptable in real-time safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where untimely computation can have catastrophic physical-world consequences.\nTo bridge this gap, we present Gecko, an attack recovery approach that not only timely recovers the execution from the attack but also disables exploited features to improve system availability. Realizing Gecko presents two technical challenges. To defend against repeated exploitation, Gecko utilizes compartmentalization for runtime attack input identification and introduces fail-safe shadow compartments to disable the exploited features while ensuring graceful degradation. To remove attack impacts in a timely manner, Gecko employs selective data reset through snapshot recovery. It further uses an I/O reference monitor to avoid peripheral re-configuration. We developed a prototype of Gecko and evaluated it on three CPS platforms: ArduPilot, Jackal UGV, and OpenManipulator. Gecko achieves recovery with 83.3% task deadline hits while incurring a runtime overhead of 8.28%."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/sun-shiyu",
    "abstract": "Security patches are crucial for preserving the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of computing resources. However, their deployment can be significantly postponed when intertwined with non-security patches. Existing code change decomposition methods are primarily designed for code review, focusing on connecting related parts. However, they often include irrelevant statements in a bloated security patch, complicating security patch detection, verification, and deployment. In this paper, we develop a patch decomposition system named DISPATCH for unraveling individual security patches from entangled code changes. We first introduce a graph representation named PatchGraph to capture the fine-grained code modifications by retaining changed syntax and dependency. Next, we perform a two-stage patch dependency analysis to group the changed statements addressing the same vulnerability into individual security patches. The first stage focuses on the statement level, where boundaries are defined to exclude unrelated statements. The second stage analyzes the unvisited dependencies, ensuring the patch's applicability by maintaining syntactic correctness and function completeness. In the evaluation across four popular software repositories (i.e., OpenSSL, Linux Kernel, ImageMagick, and Nginx), DISPATCH can unravel individual security patches from entangled ones with over 91.9% recall, outperforming existing methods by at least 20% in accuracy."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/yang-yuchen",
    "abstract": "Perceptual hashing (PHash) systemsâe.g., Apple's NeuralHash, Microsoft's PhotoDNA, and Facebook's PDQâare widely employed to screen illicit content. Such systems generate hashes of image files and match them against a database of known hashes linked to illicit content for filtering. One important drawback of PHash systems is that they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbation attacks leading to hash evasion or collision. It is desirable to bring provable guarantees to PHash systems to certify their robustness under evasion or collision attacks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing certified PHash systems, and more importantly, the training of certified PHash systems is challenging because of the unique definition of model utility and the existence of both evasion and collision attacks.\nIn this paper, we propose CertPHash, the first certified PHash system with robust training. CertPHash includes three different optimization terms, anti-evasion, anti-collision, and functionality. The anti-evasion term establishes an upper bound on the hash deviation caused by input perturbations, the anti-collision term sets a lower bound on the distance between a perturbed hash and those from other inputs, and the functionality term ensures that the system remains reliable and effective throughout robust training. Our results demonstrate that CertPHash not only achieves non-vacuous certification for both evasion and collision with provable guarantees but is also robust against empirical attacks. Furthermore, CertPHash demonstrates strong performance in real-world illicit content detection tasks."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs), built on pre-trained vision encoders and large language models (LLMs), have shown exceptional multi-modal understanding and dialog capabilities, positioning them as catalysts for the next technological revolution. However, while most VLM research focuses on enhancing multi-modal interaction, the risks of data misuse and leakage have been largely unexplored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs.\nIn this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario. Our comprehensive evaluations show that these methods can accurately determine membership status, e.g., achieving an AUC greater than 0.8 targeting a small set consisting of only 5 samples on LLaVA."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database and applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single \"blocker\" document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe.\nWe describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM.\nWe evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chou",
    "abstract": "New privacy concerns arise with chatbots on group messaging platforms. Chatbots may access information beyond their intended functionalities, such as sender identities or messages unintended for chatbots. Chatbot developers may exploit such information to infer personal information and link users across groups, potentially leading to data breaches, pervasive tracking, or targeted advertising. Our analysis of conversation datasets shows that (1) chatbots often access far more messages than needed, and (2) when a user joins a new group with chatbots, there is a 3.6% chance that at least one of the chatbots can recognize and associate the user with their previous interactions in other groups. Although state-of-the-art (SoA) group messaging protocols provide robust end-to-end encryption and some platforms have implemented policies to limit chatbot access, no platforms successfully combine these features. This paper introduces SnoopGuard, a secure group messaging protocol that ensures user privacy against chatbots while maintaining strong end-to-end security. Our protocol offers (1) selective message access, preventing chatbots from accessing unrelated messages, and (2) sender anonymity, hiding user identities from chatbots. SnoopGuard achieves $O(\\log n + m)$ message-sending complexity for a group of $n$ users and $m$ chatbots, compared to $O(\\log(n + m))$ in SoA protocols, with acceptable overhead for enhanced privacy. Our prototype implementation shows that sending a message to a group of 50 users and 10 chatbots takes about 10 milliseconds when integrated with Message Layer Security (MLS)."

    "abstract": "Private Join and Compute (PJC) is a two-party protocol recently proposed by Google for various use-cases, including ad conversion (Asiacrypt 2021) and which generalizes their deployed private set intersection sum (PSI-SUM) protocol (EuroS&P 2020). PJC allows two parties, each holding a key-value database, to privately evaluate the inner product of the values whose keys lie in the intersection. While the functionality output is not typically considered in the security model of the MPC literature, it may pose real-world privacy risks, thus raising concerns about the potential deployment of protocols like PJC.\nIn this work, we analyze the risks associated with the PJC functionality output. We consider an adversary that is a participating party of PJC and describe four practical attacks that break the other party's input privacy, and which are able to recover both membership of keys in the intersection and their associated values. Our attacks consider the privacy threats associated with deployment and highlight the need to include the functionality output as part of the MPC security model."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/bormet",
    "abstract": "In decentralized finance (DeFi), the public availability of pending transactions presents significant privacy concerns, enabling market manipulation through miner extractable value (MEV). MEV occurs when block proposers exploit the ability to reorder, omit, or include transactions, causing financial loss to users from frontrunning. Recent research has focused on encrypting pending transactions, hiding transaction data until block finalization. To this end, Choudhuri et al. (USENIX '24) introduce an elegant new primitive called Batched Threshold Encryption (BTE) where a batch of encrypted transactions is selected by a committee and only decrypted after block finalization. Crucially, BTE achieves low communication complexity during decryption and guarantees that all encrypted transactions outside the batch remain private. An important shortcoming of their construction is, however, that it progresses in epochs and requires a costly setup in MPC for each batch decryption. In this work, we introduce a novel BTE scheme addressing the limitations by eliminating the need for an expensive epoch setup while achieving practical encryption and decryption times. Additionally, we explore a previously ignored question of how users can coordinate their transactions, which is crucial for the functionality of the system. Along the way, we present several optimizations and trade-offs between communication and computational complexity that allows us to achieve practical performance on standard hardware (< 2 ms for encryption and < 440 ms for decrypting 512 transactions). Finally, we prove our constructions secure in a model that captures practical attacks on MEV-prevention mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Attackers regularly use SSH (Secure SHell) to compromise systems, e.g., via brute-force attacks, establishing persistence by deploying SSH public keys. This ranges from IoT botnets like Mirai, over loader and dropper systems, to the back-ends of malicious operations. Identifying compromised systems at the Internet scale would be a major break-through for combatting malicious activity by enabling targeted clean-up efforts.\nIn this paper, we present a method to identify compromised SSH servers at scale. For this, we use SSH's behavior to only send a challenge during public key authentication, to check if the key is present on the system. Our technique neither allows us to access compromised systems (unlike, e.g., testing known attacker passwords), nor does it require access for auditing.\nWith our methodology used at an Internet-wide scan, we identify more than 21,700 unique systems (1,649 ASes, 144 countries) where attackers installed at least one of 52 verified malicious keys provided by a threat intelligence company, including critical Internet infrastructure. Furthermore, we find new context on the activities of malicious campaigns like, e.g., the 'fritzfrog' IoT botnet, malicious actors like 'teamtnt', and even the presence of state-actor associated keys within sensitive ASes. Comparing to honeypot data, we find these to under-/over-represent attackers' activity, even underestimating some APTs' activities. Finally, we collaborate with a national CSIRT and the Shadowserver Foundation to notify and remediate compromised systems. We run our measurements continuously and automatically share notifications."

    "abstract": "Internet-wide scanning services are widely used for attack surface discovery across organizations and the Internet. Enterprises, government agencies, and researchers rely on these tools to assess risks to Internet-facing infrastructure. However, their reliability and trustworthiness remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by comparing results from three commercial scanners â Shodan, ONYPHE, and LeakIX â with findings from our independent experiments using verified Nuclei templates, designed to identify specific vulnerabilities through crafted benign requests. We found that the payload-based detections of Shodan are mostly confirmed. Yet, Nuclei finds many more vulnerable endpoints, so defenders might face massive underreporting. For Shodan's banner-based detections, the opposite issue arises: a significant overreporting of false positives. This indicates that banner-based detections are unreliable. Moreover, three commercial services and Nuclei scans exhibit significant discrepancies. Our work has implications for industry users, policymakers, and the many academic researchers who rely on the results provided by these attack surface management services. By highlighting their shortcomings in vulnerability monitoring, this work serves as a call for action to advance and standardize such services to enhance their trustworthiness."

    "abstract": "Open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced, blending natural language with visual modalities, leading them to achieve remarkable performance on tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains uncertain, as real-world imagesâparticularly hateful memesâoften convey complex semantics, cultural references, and emotional signals far beyond those in experimental datasets. In this paper, we present an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret hateful memes by curating a dataset of 39 hateful memes and 12,775 responses from seven representative VLMs using carefully designed prompts. Our manual annotations of the responses' informativeness and soundness reveal that VLMs can identify visual concepts and understand cultural and emotional backgrounds, especially for the well-known hateful memes. However, we find that the VLMs lack robust safeguards to effectively detect and reject hateful content, making them vulnerable to misuse for generating harmful outputs such as hate speech and offensive slogans. Our findings show that 40% of VLM-generated hate speech and over 10% of hateful jokes and slogans were flagged as harmful, emphasizing the urgent need for stronger safety measures and ethical guidelines to mitigate misuse. We hope our study serves as a foundation for improving VLM safety and ethical standards in handling hateful content."

In part enabling this growth, several markets have emerged to support the buying and selling of sexual deepfake material. In this paper, we systematically characterize the most prominent and mainstream marketplace, MrDeepFakes. We analyze the marketplace economics, the targets of created media, and user discussions of how to create deepfakes, which we use to understand the current state-of-the-art in deepfake creation. Our work uncovers little enforcement of posted rules (e.g., limiting targeting to well-established celebrities), previously undocumented attacker motivations, and unexplored attacker tactics for acquiring resources to create sexual deepfakes."

    "abstract": "Effective verification of the true positives from false positives is crucial for improving the usability of static analysis tools and bolstering software security. Directed greybox fuzzing (DGF), based on dynamic execution, can confirm real vulnerabilities and provide proof-of-concept exploits, offering a promising solution. However, existing DGF tools are ineffective in verifying static analysis results because they are unaware of the semantic information about individual alarms and the correlations among multiple alarms.\nIn this paper, we fill this gap and present Lyso, the first multi-target, multi-step guided fuzzer that leverages semantic information (i.e., program flows) and correlations (i.e., shared root causes) derived from static analysis. By concurrently handling multiple alarms and prioritizing seeds that cover these root causes, Lyso efficiently explores multiple alarms. For each alarm, Lyso breaks down the goal of reaching an alarm into a sequence of manageable steps. By progressively following these steps, Lyso refines its search to reach the final step, significantly improving its ability to trigger challenging alarms.\nWe compared Lyso to eight state-of-the-art (directed) fuzzers. Our evaluation demonstrates that Lyso outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average 12.17x speedup while finding the highest absolute number of bugs. Additionally, we applied Lyso to verify static analysis results for real-world programs, and it successfully discovered eighteen new vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "Deepfake detectors relying on heuristics and machine learning are locked in a perpetual struggle against evolving attacks. In contrast, cryptographic solutions provide strong safeguards against deepfakes by creating hardware-binding digital signatures when capturing (real) images. While effective, they falter when attackers misuse cameras to recapture images of digitally generated fake images from a display or other medium. This vulnerability reduces the security assurance back to the effectiveness of deepfake detectors. The main difference, however, is that a successful attack must now deceive two types of detectors simultaneously: deepfake detectors and detectors specialized for detecting image recaptures.\nThis paper introduces Chimera, an end-to-end attack strategy that crafts cryptographically signed fake images capable of deceiving both deepfake and image recapture detectors. Chimera demonstrates that current adversarial and generative models fail to effectively deceive both detector types or lack generalization across different setups. Chimera addresses this gap by using a hardware-aware adversarial compensator to craft fake images that successfully bypass state-of-the-art detection mechanisms. The key innovation is a GAN-based image generator that accounts for and compensates the physical transformations introduced during the recapture process. Through rigorous testing using commercial off-the-shelf cameras and displays, Chimera proves effective in fooling both types of detectors with a high success rate while having high visual quality (compared to the original real image). Chimera demonstrates the vulnerability of deepfake detectors even when equipped with hardware-based digital signatures. Our successful end-to-end attack on state-of-the-art detectors shows an urgent need for more robust detection and mitigation strategies."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in various domain-specific tasks, with their performance often improving substantially after fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning with real-world data introduces privacy risks. To mitigate these risks, developers increasingly rely on synthetic data generation as an alternative to using real data, as data generated by traditional models is believed to be different from real-world data. However, with the advanced capabilities of LLMs, the distinction between real data and data generated by these models has become nearly indistinguishable. This convergence introduces similar privacy risks for generated data to those associated with real data. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of this underexplored issue by investigating a key question: Does fine-tuning with LLM-generated data enhance privacy, or does it pose additional privacy risks?\" Our study investigates this question by examining the structural characteristics of data generated by LLMs, focusing on two primary fine-tuning approaches: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with unstructured (plain-text) generated data and self-instruct tuning. In the scenario of SFT, the data is put into a particular instruction tuning format used by previous studies. We use Personal Information Identifier (PII) leakage and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on the Pythia Model Suite and Open Pre-trained Transformer (OPT) to measure privacy risks. Notably, after fine-tuning with unstructured generated data, the rate of successful PII extractions for Pythia increased by over 20%, highlighting the potential privacy implications of such approaches. Furthermore, the ROC-AUC score of MIAs for Pythia-6.9b, the second biggest model of the suite, increases over 40% after self-instruct tuning. Our results indicate the potential privacy risks associated with fine-tuning LLMs using generated data, underscoring the need for careful consideration of privacy safeguards in such approaches."

Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor network traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices, suggesting that attackers are using Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained from underground markets). To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed TORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting cloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic. TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via specific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes for cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-ofthought (CoT) process with large language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.\nOur results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that attackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting cloudless IoT devices. Over a period of 12 months, TORCHLIGHT analyzed 26 TB of traffic, revealing 45 vulnerabilities, including 29 zero-day exploits with 25 CVE-IDs assigned (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW) and an estimated value of approximately $312,000. These vulnerabilities affect around 12.71 million devices across 148 countries, exposing them to severe risks such as information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary command execution. The findings have attracted significant attention, sparking widespread discussion in cybersecurity circles, reaching the top 25 on Hacker News, and generating over 190,000 views."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of mobile apps has provided convenience and entertainment, including adult-oriented apps for users 18 and older. Despite various strategies to prevent minors from accessing such content, the effectiveness of these measures remains uncertain. This paper investigates these mechanisms and proposes a novel detection solution: GUARD (Guarding Underage Access Restriction Detection). GUARD determines relevant components (e.g., those that can accept the user's age or birthdate) based on the spatial relationships of the components in a layout and tracks the data flows through taint analysis. Recognizing static analysis limitations, GUARD also dynamically interacts with apps to identify age-related input components, which are then used for precise taint analysis. Our analysis of 31,750 adult-only apps (out of 693,334 apps on Google Play) reveals that only 1,165 (3.67%) implement age verification, with the majority relying on the weakest method, the age gate (which simply asks users if they are over 18). Even apps with stronger age verification (e.g., document uploads, online ID verification) can be bypassed using simple methods like false IDs or fake documents. They can also be circumvented through accounts from services without age checks (e.g., OAuth abuse) or by exploiting regional differences via VPNs. This paper also proposes countermeasures to enhance the effectiveness of age verification methods, which received positive feedback from Google through our email exchanges."

We implement DPA-GNN, which to our knowledge, is the most effective privacy-preserving GNN model suitable for distributed contexts. Through extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, DPA-GNN has proven to consistently surpass existing privacy preserving GNNs, offering an optimal balance between privacy and utility."

    "abstract": "Anonymity is essential for free speech and expressing dissent, but platform moderators need ways to police bad actors. For anonymous clients, this may involve banning their accounts, docking their reputation, or updating their state in a complex access control scheme. Frequently, these operations happen asynchronously when some violation, e.g., a forum post, is found well after the offending action occurred. Malicious clients, naturally, wish to evade this asynchronous negative feedback. This raises a challenge: how can multiple parties interact with private state stored by an anonymous client while ensuring state integrity and supporting oblivious updates?\nWe propose zk-promises, a framework supporting stateful anonymous credentials where the state machines are Turing-complete and support asynchronous callbacks. Client state is stored in what we call a zk-object held by the client, zero-knowledge proofs ensure the object can only be updated as programmed, and callbacks allow third party updates even for anonymous clients, e.g, for downvotes or banning. Clients scan for callbacks periodically and update their state. When clients authenticate, they anonymously assert some predicate on their state and that they have scanned recently (e.g, within the past 24 hours).\nzk-promises allows us to build a privacy-preserving account model. State that would normally be stored on a trusted server can be privately outsourced to the client while preserving the server's ability to update the account.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we design, implement, and benchmark an anonymous reputation system with better-than-state-of-the-art performance and features, supporting asynchronous reputation updates, banning, and reputation-dependent rate limiting to better protect against Sybil attacks."

    "abstract": "To bridge the ever-increasing gap between the fast execution speed of modern processors and the long latency of memory accesses, CPU vendors continue to introduce newer and more advanced optimizations. While these optimizations improve performance, research has repeatedly demonstrated that they may also have an adverse impact on security.\nIn this work, we identify that recent Apple M- and A-series processors implement a load value predictor (LVP), an optimization that predicts the contents of memory that the processor loads before the contents are actually available. This allows processors to alleviate slowdowns from Read-After-Write dependencies, as instructions can now be executed in parallel rather than sequentially. \nTo evaluate the security impact of Apple's LVP implementation, we first investigate the implementation, identifying the conditions for prediction. We then show that although the LVP cannot directly predict 64-bit values (e.g., pointers), prediction of smaller-size values can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary memory access. Finally, we demonstrate end-to-end attack exploit chains that build on the LVP to obtain a 64-bit read primitive within the Safari and Chrome browsers."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/he",
    "abstract": "Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Although prior research has extensively explored MIAs in Large Language Models (LLMs), they typically require accessing to complete output logits (i.e., logits-based attacks), which are usually not available in practice. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of pre-trained LLMs to MIAs in the label-only setting, where the adversary can only access generated tokens (text). We first reveal that existing label-only MIAs have minor effects in attacking pre-trained LLMs, although they are highly effective in inferring fine-tuning datasets used for personalized LLMs. We find that their failure stems from two main reasons, including better generalization and overly coarse perturbation. Specifically, due to the extensive pre-training corpora and exposing each sample only a few times, LLMs exhibit minimal robustness differences between members and non-members. This makes token-level perturbations too coarse to capture such differences.\nTo alleviate these problems, we propose PETAL: a label-only membership inference attack based on PEr-Token semAntic simiLarity. Specifically, PETAL leverages token-level semantic similarity to approximate output probabilities and subsequently calculate the perplexity. It finally exposes membership based on the common assumption that members are 'better' memorized and have smaller perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the WikiMIA benchmark and the more challenging MIMIR benchmark. Empirically, our PETAL performs better than the extensions of existing label-only attacks against personalized LLMs and even on par with other advanced logit-based attacks across all metrics on five prevalent open-source LLMs. Our study highlights that pre-trained LLMs remain vulnerable to privacy risks posed by MIAs even in the most challenging and realistic setting, calling for attention to develop more effective defenses."

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been significant interest from policymakers in addressing ransomware through policy and regulations, yet this process remains far more of an art than a science. This paper introduces a novel method for quantitatively evaluating policy proposals: we create a simulated game theoretic agent-based economic model of security and use it as a testbed for several policy interventions, including a hands-off approach, mandatory minimum investments, and mandatory cyber insurance. Notably, we find that the bottleneck for better security outcomes lies not in better defender decision-making but in improved coordination between defenders: using our model, we find that a policy requiring defenders to invest at least 2% of resources into security each round produces better overall outcomes than leaving security investment decisions to defenders even when the defenders are \"perfect play\" utility maximizers. This provides evidence that security is a weakest-link game and makes the case for mandatory security minimums. Using our model, we also find that cyber insurance does little to improve overall outcomes. To make our tool accessible to others, we have made the code open source and released it as an online web application."

Phantom employs reinforcement learning to add lightweight obfuscation layers, degrading model performance for adversaries while maintaining functionality for authorized user. To reduce the off-chip data communication between TEE and GPU, we propose a Top-K layer-wise obfuscation sensitivity analysis method. Extensive experiments demonstrate Phantom's superiority over state-of-the-art (SoTA) defense methods against model stealing and fine-tuning attacks across various architectures and datasets. It reduces unauthorized accuracy to near-random guessing (e.g., 10% for CIFAR-10 tasks, 1% for CIFAR-100 tasks) and achieves a 6.99% average attack success rate for model stealing, significantly outperforming SoTA competing methods. System implementation on Intel SGX2 and NVIDIA GPU heterogeneous system achieves 35% end-to-end latency reduction compared with most recent SoTA work."

    "abstract": "Multi-party computation (MPC) based machine learning, referred to as multi-party learning (MPL), has become an important technology for utilizing data from multiple parties with privacy preservation. In recent years, in order to apply MPL in more practical scenarios, various MPC-friendly models have been proposedto reduce the extraordinary communication overhead of MPL. Within the optimization of MPC-friendly models, a critical element to tackle the challenge is profiling the communication cost of models. However, the current solutions mainly depend on manually establishing the profiles to identify communication bottlenecks of models, often involving burdensome human efforts in a monotonous procedure.\nIn this paper, we propose HawkEye, a static model communication cost profiling framework, which enables model designers to get the accurate communication cost of models in MPL frameworks without dynamically running the secure model training or inference processes on a specific MPL framework. Firstly, to profile the communication cost of models with complex structures, we propose a static communication cost profiling method based on a prefix structure that records the function calling chain during the static analysis. Secondly, HawkEye employs an automatic differentiation library to assist model designers in profiling the communication cost of models in PyTorch. Finally, we compare the static profiling results of HawkEye against the profiling results obtained through dynamically running secure model training and inference processes on five popular MPL frameworks, CryptFlow2, CrypTen, Delphi, Cheetah, and SecretFlow-SEMI2K. The experimental results show that HawkEye can accurately profile the model communication cost without dynamic profiling."

    "abstract": "Domain registries manage the entire lifecycle of domain names within TLDs and interact with domain registrars through the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) specification. Although they adhere to standard policies, EPP implementations and operational practices can vary between registries. Even minor operational flaws at registries can expose their managed resources to abuse. However, registry operations' closed and opaque nature has limited understanding of these practices and their potential threats. In this study, we systematically analyzed the security of EPP operations across TLD registries. By analyzing the entire domain lifecycle and mapping operations to corresponding domain statuses, we discovered that registry operations are attributed to overlapping statuses and complex triggering factors. To uncover flaws in registry operations, we employed diverse data sources, including TLD zone files, historical domain registration data, and real-time registrar interfaces for comprehensive domain statuses. The analysis combined static and dynamic techniques, allowing us to externally assess domain existence and registration status, thereby revealing the inner workings of registry policies. Eventually, we discovered three novel EPP implementation deficiencies that pose domain abuse risks in major registries, including Identity Digital, Google, and Nominet. Evidence has shown that adversaries are covertly exploiting these vulnerabilities. Our experiments reveal that over 1.6 million domain names, spanning more than 50% of TLDs (e.g., .app and .top), are vulnerable due to these flawed operations. To address these issues, we responsibly disclosed the problem to the affected registries and assisted in implementing a solution. We believe that these registry operation issues require increased attention from the community."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/deng",
    "abstract": "Software supply chain attacks pose an increasingly severe threat to the security of downstream software worldwide. A common method to mitigate these risks is Software Composition Analysis (SCA), which helps developers identify vulnerable dependencies. However, studies show that popular SCA approaches often suffer from high false positive rates. As a result, developers spend significant time manually validating these alerts, which delays the detection and remediation of genuinely exploitable upstream vulnerabilities.\nIn this paper, we propose ChainFuzz, an automated approach for validating upstream vulnerabilities in downstream software by generating Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs). To achieve this, ChainFuzz addresses three key challenges. First, intra-layer code and constraints. Downstream software introduces custom code and sanity checks that significantly alter the triggering paths and conditions of upstream vulnerabilities. Second, inter-layer dependencies. Software supply chains often involve cross-layer control-flow and data-flow dependencies between conditional statements across different layers. Third, long supply chains. Transitive dependencies in long chains result in intricate exploitation paths, making it challenging to explore large code spaces and handle deeply nested constraints effectively.\nWe comprehensively evaluate ChainFuzz using our dataset, which comprises 66 unique vulnerability and supply chain combinations. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in generating PoCs for both direct and transitive vulnerable dependencies. Additionally, we compare ChainFuzz with representative fuzzing tools: AFLGo, AFL++, and NestFuzz, highlighting its superior performance in downstream PoC generation."

To elicit LLMs to effectively reason about vulnerable code behaviors, which is essential for quality patch generation, we introduce vulnerability semantics reasoning and adaptive prompting on LLMs and instantiate the methodology as APPATCH, an automated LLM-based patching system. Our evaluation of APPATCH on 97 zero-day vulnerabilities and 20 existing vulnerabilities demonstrates its superior performance to both existing prompting methods and state-of-the-art non-LLM-based techniques (by up to 28.33% in F1 and 182.26% in recall over the best baseline). Through APPATCH, we demonstrate what helps for LLM-based patching and how, as well as discussing what still lacks and why."

Yet, these models are often plagued by the hallucination problem, which involves generating inaccurate objects, attributes, and relationships that do not match the visual content. In this work, we delve into the internal attention mechanisms of MLLMs to reveal the underlying causes of hallucination, exposing the inherent vulnerabilities in the instruction-tuning process.\nWe propose a novel hallucination attack against MLLMs that exploits attention sink behaviors to trigger hallucinated content with minimal image-text relevance, posing a significant threat to critical downstream applications. Distinguished from previous adversarial methods that rely on fixed patterns, our approach generates dynamic, effective, and highly transferable visual adversarial inputs, without sacrificing the quality of model responses. Comprehensive experiments on 6 prominent MLLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our attack in compromising black-box MLLMs even with extensive mitigating mechanisms, as well as the promising results against cutting-edge commercial APIs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5.

    "abstract": "Many open-sourced audio datasets require that they can only be adopted for academic or educational purposes, yet there is currently no effective method to ensure compliance with these conditions. Ideally, the dataset owner can apply a watermark to their dataset, enabling them to identify any model that utilizes the watermarked data. While traditional backdoor-based approaches can achieve this objective, they present significant drawbacks: 1) they introduce harmful backdoors into the model; 2) they are ineffective with black-box models; 3) they compromise audio quality; 4) they are easily detectable due to their static backdoor patterns. In this paper, we introduce AUDIO WATERMARK, a dynamic and harmless watermark specifically designed for black-box voice dataset copyright protection. The dynamism of the watermark is achieved through a style-transfer generative model and random reference style patterns; its harmlessness is ensured by utilizing an out-of-domain (OOD) feature, which allows the watermark to be correctly recognized by the watermarked model without altering the ground truth label. The efficacy in black-box settings is accomplished through a bi-level adversarial optimization strategy, which trains a generalized model to counteract the watermark generator, thereby enhancing the watermark's stealthiness across multiple target models. We evaluate our watermark across 2 voice datasets and 10 speaker recognition models, comparing it with 10 existing protections and testing it in 8 attack scenarios. We achieve minimal harmful impact, with nearly 100% benign accuracy, a 95% verification success rate, and demonstrate resistance to all tested attacks."

    "abstract": "Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work consensus to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in September 2022. While this upgrade brings significant improvements (e.g., lower energy costs and higher throughput), it also introduces new vulnerabilities. One notable example is the so-called malicious reorganization attack. Malicious reorganization denotes an attack in which the Byzantine faulty validators intentionally manipulate the canonical chain so the blocks by honest validators are discarded. By doing so, the faulty validators can gain benefits such as higher rewards, lower chain quality, or even posing a liveness threat to the system.\nIn this work, we show that the majority of the known attacks on Ethereum PoS are some form of reorganization attacks. In practice, most of these attacks can be launched even if the network is synchronous (there exists a known upper bound for message transmission and processing). Different from existing studies that mitigate the attacks in an ad-hoc way, we take a systematic approach and provide an elegant yet efficient solution to reorganization attacks. Our solution is provably secure such that no reorganization attacks can be launched in a synchronous network. In a partially synchronous network, our approach achieves the conventional safety and liveness properties of the consensus protocol. Our evaluation results show that our solution is resilient to five types of reorganization attacks and also highly efficient."

    "abstract": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use smart contracts to foster communities working toward common goals. Existing definitions of decentralization, howeverâthe 'D' in DAOâfall short of capturing the key properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation.\nThis work proposes a new framework for measuring DAO decentralization called Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced \"vibe\"). VBE is based on the idea that voters with closely aligned interests act as a centralizing force and should be modeled as such. VBE formalizes this notion by measuring the similarity of participants' utility functions across a set of voting rounds. Unlike prior, ad hoc definitions of decentralization, VBE derives from first principles: We introduce a simple (yet powerful) reinforcement learning-based conceptual model for voting, that in turn implies VBE.\nWe first show VBE's utility as a theoretical tool. We prove a number of results about the (de)centralizing effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, etc. that are overlooked in previous notions of DAO decentralization. Our results lead to practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization.\nWe also show how VBE can be used empirically by presenting measurement studies and VBE-based governance experiments. We make the tools we developed for these results available to the community in the form of open-source artifacts in order to facilitate future study of DAO decentralization."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/choudhuri",
    "abstract": "An important consideration with the growth of the DeFi ecosystem is the protection of clients who submit transactions to the system. As it currently stands, the public visibility of these transactions in the memory pool (mempool) makes them susceptible to market manipulations such as frontrunning and backrunning. More broadly, for various reasonsâranging from avoiding market manipulation to including time-sensitive information in their transactionsâclients may want the contents of their transactions to remain private until they are executed, i.e. they have pending transaction privacy. Therefore, mempool privacy is becoming an increasingly important feature as DeFi applications continue to spread.\nWe construct the first practical mempool privacy scheme that uses a one-time DKG setup for n decryption servers. Our scheme ensures the strong privacy requirement by not only hiding the transactions until they are decrypted but also guaranteeing privacy for transactions that were not selected in the epoch (pending transaction privacy). For each epoch (or block), clients can encrypt their transactions so that, once B (encrypted) transactions are selected for the epoch, they can be decrypted by each decryption server while communicating only O(1) information.\nOur result improves upon the best-known prior works, which either: (i) require an expensive initial setup involving a (special purpose) multiparty computation protocol executed by the n decryption servers, along with an additional per-epoch setup; (ii) require each decryption server to communicate O(B) information; or (iii) do not guarantee pending transaction privacy.\nWe implement our scheme and find that transactions can be encrypted in approximately 8.5 ms, independent of committee size, and the communication required to decrypt an entire batch of transactions is 48 bytes per party, independent of the number of transactions. If deployed on Ethereum, which processes close to 500 transactions per block, it takes close to 3.2 s for each committee member to compute a partial decryption and 3.0 s to decrypt all transactions for a block in single-threaded mode. Compared to prior work, which had an expensive setup phase per epoch, we incur < 2x overhead in the worst case. On some metrics such as partial decryptions size, we actually fare better."

In the sequential setting, our oblivious join performs 4.6x - 5.14x faster than the prior state-of-the-art solution (Krastnikov et al., VLDB 2020) on data sets of size n=2^24. In the parallel setting, our algorithm achieves a speedup of up to roughly 16x over the sequential version, when running with 32 threads (becoming up to 80x compared to the sequential algorithm of Krastnikov et al.). Finally, our oblivious operators can be used independently to support other oblivious relational database queries, such as oblivious selection and oblivious group-by."

To achieve this, we propose three constructions incorporating several new techniques. The high-level approach involves (1) encoding the server's key-value database into an indexable database with a key-to-index mapping and (2) invoking standard PIR on the encoded database to retrieve specific positions based on the mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, with results showing substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art keyword PIR, ChalametPIR (CCS '24), i.e., a 15â¼178 x reduction in communication and 1.1 â¼ 2.4 x runtime improvement, depending on database size and entry length.

    "abstract": "We present the first large-scale analysis of 339 cybercriminal activity channels (CACs). Followed by over 23.8M users, these broadcast-style channels share a wide array of malicious and unethical content with their subscribers, including compromised credentials, pirated software and media, social media manipulation tools, and blackhat hacking resources such as malware and exploit kits, and social engineering scams. To evaluate these channels, we developed DarkGramâa BERT-based framework that automatically identifies malicious posts from the CACs with an accuracy of 96%. Using DarkGram, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 53,605 posts posted on these channels between February and May 2024, revealing key characteristics of shared content. While much of this content is distributed for free, channel administrators frequently employ strategies, such as promotions and giveaways, to engage users and boost the sales of premium cybercriminal content. Interestingly, sometimes, these channels pose significant risks to their own subscribers. Notably, 28.1% of the links shared in these channels contained phishing attacks, and 38% of executable files were bundled with malware. Looking closely into how subscribers consume and react positively to the shared content paints a dangerous picture of the perpetuation of cybercriminal content at scale. We also found that the CACs can evade scrutiny or platform takedowns by quickly migrating to new channels with minimal subscriber loss, highlighting the resilience of this ecosystem. To counteract this, we utilized DarkGram to detect emerging channels and reported malicious content to Telegram and the affected organizations. This resulted in the takedown of 196 channels over the course of three months. Our findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts to combat the growing threats posed by these channels. To aid this effort, we open-source our dataset and the DarkGram framework."

We analyze BFT SMR in the excessive fault setting where the actual number of Byzantine faults surpasses a protocol's tolerance.\nWe start by devising the very first repair algorithm for linearly chained and quorum-based partially synchronous SMR to recover from faulty states caused by excessive faults. Such a procedure can be realized using any commission fault detection moduleâan algorithm that identifies the faulty replicas without falsely locating any correct replica. We achieve this with a slightly weaker liveness guarantee, as the original security notion is impossible to satisfy given excessive faults.\nWe implement recoverable HotStuff in Rust. The throughput resumes to the normal level (without excessive faults) after recovery routines terminate for 7 replicas and is slightly reduced by leq 4.3% for 30 replicas. On average, it increases the latency by 12.87% for 7 replicas and 8.85% for 30 replicas.\nAside from adopting existing detection modules, we also establish the sufficient condition for a general BFT SMR protocol to allow for complete and sound fault detection when up to (n-2) Byzantine replicas (out of n total replicas) attack safety. We start by providing the first closed-box fault detection algorithm for any SMR protocol without any extra rounds of communication. We then describe open-box instantiations of our fault detection routines in Tendermint and Hotstuff, further reducing the overhead, both asymptotically and concretely."

    "abstract": "Data-oriented programming (DOP) is a methodology for embedding malicious programs into fixed executable vulnerable binaries. DOP is effective for implementing code reuse attacks that exploit memory corruptions without violating many defence techniques, such as non-execute, address space layer randomisation, control flow and code point integrity. Existing approaches for automated exploit generation for DOP follow the program synthesis approach: given a description of an attack phrased as a program, they perform extensive constraint-based search to identify the required payload for the corrupted memory. The program synthesis-inspired approaches come with three major shortcomings regarding (a) efficiency: attack generation often takes prohibitively large amount of time, (b) soundness: they provide no formal guarantees whatsoever that a particular user-described attack is feasible in a particular vulnerable program with suitable payloads, and (c) capability visibility: they do not make clear to users what attack capabilities are admitted by the vulnerable program.\nIn this work, we propose a novel approach to synthesise code reuse attacks via DOP by casting this task as an instance of the previously unexplored programming language synthesis idea. Given a vulnerable program and an exploit (e.g., buffer overflow), our approach derives a grammar of a programming language for describing the available attacks. Our approach addresses the issue (a) by shifting the cost of synthesising individual attacks to synthesising the entire attack language: once the grammar is generated, the compilation of each attack takes negligible time. The issues (b) and (c) are addressed by establishing correctness of our grammar synthesis algorithm: any attack expressible in terms of a generated grammar is realisable. We implement our approach in a tool called DOPPLERâan end-to-end compiler for DOP-based attacks. We evaluate DOPPLER against available state-of-the art techniques on a set of 17 case studies, including three recent CVEs, demonstrating its improved effectiveness (it generates more attacks) and efficiency (it does so much faster)."

    "abstract": "WebXR is a standard web interface for extended reality that offers virtual environments and immersive 3D interactions, distinguishing it from the traditional web. However, these novel UI properties also introduce potential avenues for dark design exploitation. For instance, the absence of iframe-like elements in WebXR can be exploited by third parties, such as ad service providers, to inject JavaScript scripts and induce unintentional clicks or extract sensitive user information.\nIn this work, our objective is to identify and analyze the UI properties of WebXR vulnerable to exploitation by both first and third parties and to understand their impact on user experience. First, we examine vulnerable UI properties and propose five novel attack techniques that exploit one or more of these properties. We systematically categorize both existing and newly identified attacks within the advertising domain, to create a comprehensive taxonomy. Second, we design a user study framework to evaluate the impact of these attack categories employing dark designs on user experience. We develop a logging system to collect spatial data from 3D user interactions and integrate it with different WebXR applications that have different interaction needs. Additionally, we develop a set of metrics to derive meaningful insights from user interaction logs and assess how dark designs affect user behavior. Finally, we conduct a 100-participant between-subjects study using our user-study framework and survey.\nOur findings suggest that most of these dark patterns go largely unnoticed by users while effectively achieving their intended goals. However, the impact of these designs varies depending on their category and application type. Our comprehensive taxonomy, logging framework, metrics, and user study results help developers review and improve their practices and inspire researchers to develop more robust defense mechanisms to protect user data in immersive platforms."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/tu",
    "abstract": "Private set union (PSU) allows two parties to compute the union of their sets without revealing anything else. It can be categorized into balanced and unbalanced scenarios depending on the size of the set on both sides. Recently, Jia et al. (USENIX Security 2024) highlight that existing scalable PSU solutions suffer from during-execution leakage and propose a PSU with enhanced security for the balanced setting. However, their protocol's complexity is superlinear with the size of the set. Thus, the problem of constructing a linear enhanced PSU remains open, and no unbalanced enhanced PSU exists. In this work, we address these two open problems:\n\nBalanced case: We propose the first linear enhanced PSU. Compared to the state-of-the-art enhanced PSU (Jia et al., USENIX Security 2024), our protocol achieves a 2.2 - 8.8x reduction in communication cost and a 1.2 - 8.6x speedup in running time, depending on set sizes and network environments.\nUnbalanced case: We present the first unbalanced enhanced PSU, which achieves sublinear communication complexity in the size of the large set. Experimental results demonstrate that the larger the difference between the two set sizes, the better our protocol performs. For unbalanced set sizes (2^10, 2^20) with single thread in 1Mbps bandwidth, our protocol requires only 2.322 MB of communication. Compared with the state-of-the-art enhanced PSU, there is 38.1x shrink in communication and roughly 17.6x speedup in the running time."

    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/chakraborty",
    "abstract": "Randomizing the address-to-set mapping and partitioning of the cache has been shown to be an effective mechanism in designing secured caches. Several designs have been proposed on a variety of rationales: (1) randomized design, (2) randomized-and-partitioned design, and (3) psuedo-fully associative design. This work fills in a crucial gap in current literature on randomized caches: currently most randomized cache designs defend only contention-based attacks, and leave out considerations of cache occupancy. We perform a systematic evaluation of 5 randomized cache designs- CEASER, CEASER-S, MIRAGE, ScatterCache, and SassCache against cache occupancy wrt. both performance as well as security.\nWith respect to performance, we first establish that benchmarking strategies used by contemporary designs are unsuitable for a fair evaluation (because of differing cache configurations, choice of benchmarking suites, additional implementation-specific assumptions). We thus propose a uniform benchmarking strategy, which allows us to perform a fair and comparative analysis across all designs under various replacement policies. Likewise, with respect to security against cache occupancy attacks, we evaluate the cache designs against various threat assumptions: (1) covert channels, (2) process fingerprinting, and (3) AES key recovery (to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate full AES key recovery on a randomized cache design using cache occupancy attack). Our results establish the need to also consider cache occupancy side-channel in randomized cache design considerations."

    "abstract": "NOKEScam (NOn-sense KEyword Spear scam) is an emerging fraud technique. NOKEScam uses uncommon and usually non-sense keywords (NSKeywords) as vectors to lure victims without complex Black Hat SEO techniques. The obscure NSKeywords ensure the top search results as only NOKEScam pages are exactly matched, misleading victims into trusting them. NOKEScam severely impacts victims and search engines, but its uniqueness has hindered prior research and efficient detection methods.\nIn this paper, we report on joint work with a leading Chinese search engine to combat NOKEScam. Based on an empirical study, we identified three key observations and developed a lightweight detection system. This system can process about 2 billion URLs within one hour. Over seven months, we identified 153,975 NSKeywords across 68,863 domains. Our measurement demonstrated that leveraging search engine trust endorsement, NOKEScam websites attract an average of over 30k page views daily, indicating significant fraudulent profit potential. Driven by this, attackers persist despite search engine crackdowns, employing evasion tactics like using more domain names. Despite these tactics, our detection system remains effective, significantly suppressing the impact of NOKEScam, with a 194-fold reduction in real-world user complaints. Our findings reveal emerging fraud activities and offer valuable governance lessons for the security community."

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of HTTPS for enhanced web privacy, encrypted network traffic may still leave traces that can lead to privacy breaches. One such case concerns MPEG-DASH, one of the most popular protocols for video streaming, where video identification attacks have exploited the protocol's side-channel vulnerabilities. As shown by several works in recent years, the distinctive traffic patterns generated by DASH's adaptive bitrate streaming reveal streamed content despite TLS-protection. However, these earlier studies have not demonstrated that the vulnerability remains exploitable in large-scale attack scenarios, even when making strong assumptions about network details. To that end, this work presents a protocol-agnostic system capable of identifying videos independent of network layer information, and demonstrates a practical attack over the largest dataset to date, comprising over 240,000 videos covering three entire streaming services. Using a combination of k-d tree search and time series methods, our system achieves an accuracy of over 99.5% in real-time video identification and remains effective even in scenarios involving victims behind VPNs or where Wi-Fi eavesdropping occurs. Since large-scale video identification can compromise user privacy and enable potential mass surveillance of video services, we complement our work with an analysis of the vulnerability root cause when using adaptive bitrate streaming and propose a mitigation strategy to stand against such vulnerabilities. Recognizing the lack of open-source tooling in this domain, we publish an extensive dataset of video fingerprints, network capture data, and tools to foster awareness and prompt timely solutions within the video streaming community to address these privacy concerns effectively."

    "abstract": "BFT protocols usually have a waterfall-like degradation in performance in the face of crash faults. Some BFT protocols may not experience sudden performance degradation under crash faults. They achieve this at the expense of increased communication and round complexity in fault-free scenarios. In a nutshell, existing protocols lack the adaptability needed to perform optimally under varying conditions.\nWe propose TockOwl, the first asynchronous consensus protocol with fault adaptability. TockOwl features quadratic communication and constant round complexity, allowing it to remain efficient in fault-free scenarios. TockOwl also possesses crash robustness, enabling it to maintain stable performance when facing crash faults. These properties collectively ensure the fault adaptability of TockOwl.\nFurthermore, we propose TockOwl+ that has network adaptability. TockOwl+ incorporates both fast and slow tracks and employs hedging delays, allowing it to achieve low latency comparable to partially synchronous protocols without waiting for timeouts in asynchronous environments. Compared to the latest dual-track protocols, the slow track of TockOwl+ is simpler, implying shorter latency in fully asynchronous environments."

    "publication": "USENIX Sec",
    "paper": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zhang-kunpeng",
    "abstract": "Modern software often accepts inputs with highly complex grammars. To conduct greybox fuzzing and uncover security bugs in such software, it is essential to generate inputs that conform to the software input grammar. However, this is a well-known challenging task because it requires a deep understanding of the grammar, which is often not available and hard to infer. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that they can be used to synthesize high-quality natural language text and code that conforms to the grammar of a given input format. Nevertheless, LLMs are often incapable or too costly to generate non-textual outputs, such as images, videos, and PDF files. This limitation hinders the application of LLMs in grammar-aware fuzzing.\nWe present a novel approach to enabling grammar-aware fuzzing over non-textual inputs. We employ LLMs to synthesize and also mutate input generators, in the form of Python scripts, that generate data conforming to the grammar of a given input format. Then, non-textual data yielded by the input generators are further mutated by traditional fuzzers (AFL++) to explore the software input space effectively. Our approach, namely $G^2$FUZZ, features a hybrid strategy that combines a \"holistic search\" driven by LLMs and a \"local search\" driven by industrial quality fuzzers. Two key advantages are: (1) LLMs are good at synthesizing and mutating input generators and enabling jumping out of local optima, thus achieving a synergistic effect when combined with mutation-based fuzzers; (2) LLMs are less frequently invoked unless really needed, thus significantly reducing the cost of LLM usage. We have evaluated $G^2$FUZZ on a variety of input formats, including TIFF images, MP4 audios, and PDF files. The results show that $G^2$FUZZ outperforms SOTA tools such as AFL++, Fuzztruction, and FormatFuzzer in terms of code coverage and bug finding across most programs tested on three platforms: UNIFUZZ, FuzzBench, and MAGMA. $G^2$FUZZ also discovers 10 unique bugs in the latest real-world software, of which 3 are confirmed by CVE."

    "abstract": "We develop CoreCrisis, a stateful black-box fuzz-testing framework for 5G core network (5GC) implementations. Unlike previous stateful security analysis efforts of cellular networks which rely on manually-crafted, static test inputs and are limited to identifying only logical errors, CoreCrisis employs a dynamic two-step approach. Initially, CoreCrisis builds an initial finite state machine (FSM) representation of the 5GC's implementation using only benign (i.e., positive) inputs with its efficient and scalable divide-and-conquer and property-driven equivalence checking learning. During fuzzing, it utilizes the learned FSM to target underexplored states and introduces state-aware mutations to generate and test attacking (i.e., negative) inputs. Based on the responses observed from the core network, CoreCrisis continuously refines the FSM to better guide its exploration and find vulnerabilities. Evaluating CoreCrisis on three open-source and one commercial 5GC implementations, we identified 7 categories of deviations from the technical specifications and 13 crashing vulnerabilities. These logical and crashing vulnerabilities lead to denial-of-service, authentication bypass, and billing fraud."

In this paper, we propose FIXX, a tool that can automatically find multiple similar exploits from taint-style vulnerabilities inside the same PHP application. FIXX aims to help web application developers detect all possible instances of a known exploit within the program's code. To do this, FIXX combines novel notions of path and graph similarity over graph representations of code. We evaluate FIXX on 32 CVE reports containing cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities associated with 19 PHP applications and discover 1097 similar exploitable paths leading to 10 new CVE entries."

One major challenge in detecting Java Web Application vulnerabilities is cross-thread dataflows, which are caused by shared Java objects and triggered by multiple web requests in the same session. To the best of our knowledge, none of the prior works can handle such cross-thread dataflows in Java Web applications. \nIn this paper, we design and implement the first framework, called JAEX, to automatically detect and exploit Java Web Application vulnerabilities via concolic execution guided by so-called Cross-thread Object Manipulation. Our key insight is that cross-thread dataflows can be triggered by manipulation of shared Java objects using different requests, thus guiding concolic execution to reach the sink and generate exploits. We also evaluate JAEX on popular Java applications, which discovers 35 zero-day vulnerabilities. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to their vendors and received acknowledgments for all of them."

    "abstract": "Blockchains face significant risks from front-running attacks, leading to multi-billion USD losses. These attacks are often executed by front-running bots, automated tools that operate at high speed to execute transactions, exacerbating the threat landscape. Consequently, it is crucial for blockchain developers to design strategies at the application layer to mitigate these attacks. Interestingly, real-world strategies for evading front-running remain under-explored in their taxonomy and distribution due to their covert nature. Understanding these evasion tactics is vital for assessing the resilience of the current blockchain application layer and identifying areas for potential enhancement, thereby strengthening the ecosystem. In this work, we take the first step to demystify evading strategies in Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. We propose EVScope, a novel framework combining binary analysis and machine learning to detect known and unknown evading strategies. Using EVScope, we examine 6,761,186 arbitrage transactions and 71 significant attack transactions that evaded the front-running attacks from bots in the wild. Our findings uncover 32 refined strategies involving access control, profit control, execution split, and code obfuscation. 25/32 are first introduced in this work, and 28/32 are first applied in evading front-running, which fills a critical gap in the literature."

    "abstract": "Hardware security is crucial for ensuring trustworthy computing systems. However, the growing complexity of hardware designs has introduced new vulnerabilities that are challenging and expensive to address after fabrication. Hardware fuzz testing, particularly whitebox fuzzing, is promising for scalable and adaptable hardware vulnerability detection. Despite its potential, existing hardware fuzzers face significant challenges, including the complexity of input semantics, limited feedback utilization, and the need for extensive test cases.\nTo address these limitations, we propose GenHuzz, a novel white-box hardware fuzzing framework that reframes fuzzing as an optimization problem by optimizing the fuzzing policy to generate more subtle and effective test cases for vulnerability and bug detection. GenHuzz utilizes a language model-based fuzzer to intelligently generate RISC-V assembly instructions, which are then dynamically optimized through a Hardware-Guided Reinforcement Learning framework incorporating real-time feedback from the hardware. GenHuzz is uniquely capable of understanding and exploiting complex interdependencies between instructions, enabling the discovery of deeper bugs and vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of three RISC-V cores demonstrates that GenHuzz achieves significantly higher hardware coverage with fewer test cases than four state-of-the-art fuzzers. GenHuzz detects all known bugs reported in existing studies with fewer test cases. Furthermore, it uncovers 10 new vulnerabilities, 5 of which are the most severe hardware vulnerabilities ever detected by a hardware fuzzer targeting the same cores, with CVSS v3 severity scores exceeding 7.3 out of 10."

However, despite its growing popularity, the security of QRLogin has been overlooked. In particular, the lack of standardized QRLogin design and implementation guidelines, coupled with its wide deployment variability, raises significant concerns on the real-world deployments of QRLogin.\nThis paper presents the first systematic study on the security of QRLogin in real-world deployments. We begin our research with real-world studies to understand the deployment status of QRLogin and user perceptions of this novel authentication paradigm, which assists us in establishing a realistic threat model. We then proceed with a systematic security analysis by generalizing the typical workflow of QRLogin, examining how key variables adhere to common security principles, and ultimately exposing 6 potential flaws. We conduct security analysis on real-world QRLogin deployments with a semi-automatic detection pipeline, and reveal surprising results that 47 top websites (43% of tested) are vulnerable to at least one of the above flaws. These design and implementation flaws can lead to 5 types of attacks, including Authorization Hijacking, Double Login, Brute-force Login, Universal Account Takeover, and Privacy Abuse. We have responsibly reported all the identified issues and received 42 vulnerability IDs from official vulnerability repositories. We further provide an auditing tool and suggestions for developers and users, contributing a concerted step towards more secure implementations of QRLogin."

    "abstract": "The most widespread type of phishing attack involves email messages with links pointing to malicious content. Despite user training and the use of detection techniques, these attacks are still highly effective. Recent studies show that it is user inattentiveness, rather than lack of education, that is one of the key factors in successful phishing attacks. To this end, we develop a novel phishing defense mechanism based on URL inspection tasks: small challenges (loosely inspired by CAPTCHAs) that, to be solved, require users to interact with, and understand, the basic URL structure. We implemented and evaluated three tasks that act as \"barriers\" to visiting the website: (1) correct click-selection from a list of URLs, (2) mouse-based highlighting of the domain-name URL component, and (3) re-typing the domain-name. These tasks follow best practices in security interfaces and warning design.\nWe assessed the efficacy of these tasks through an extensive on-line user study with 2,673 participants from three different cultures, native languages, and alphabets. Results show that these tasks significantly decrease the rate of successful phishing attempts, compared to the baseline case. Results also showed the highest efficacy for difficult URLs, such as typo-squats, with which participants struggled the most. This highlights the importance of (1) slowing down users while focusing their attention and (2) helping them understand the URL structure (especially, the domain-name component thereof) and matching it to their intent."

    "abstract": "The Linux kernel has been a battleground between security researchers identifying new exploitation techniques and those developing mitigations to protect the kernel from exploitation. This is an ongoing battle: last year, Google's KernelCTF Vulnerability Research Program paid out 44 bounties for unique exploitation techniques submitted to the program, many of which targeted control flow hijacking vulnerabilities. However, the era of control flow hijacking exploits in the kernel may be coming to an end: FineIBT, now the default Control Flow Integrity measure in the Linux kernel, blocks all known control flow hijacking exploitation techniques.\nIn this paper, we propose System Register Hijacking, a previously overlooked frontier in the exploitation of control flow hijacking vulnerabilities in the kernel context. Our approach provides a comprehensive examination of typically overlooked system registers, leading us to propose several powerful exploitation techniques targeting different x86-64 system registers (e.g., cr0, cr3, and gs) and aarch64 system registers (e.g., pan, elr_el1, and vbar_el1) to break kernel security in different ways. While all of our techniques present new avenues for attackers, one in particular, which leverages the x86-64 swapgs instruction, requires neither general purpose register nor stack control, making it one of the most powerful kernel exploitation primitives currently known. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first exploitation primitive capable of bypassing the FineIBT mitigation, demonstrating not only the power of our technique but also the continued relevance of control flow hijacking vulnerabilities.\nIn addition to developing these techniques, we propose mitigations to defend against most of them. Though some of our techniques appear challenging to mitigate, our swapgs mitigation restores FineIBT's security posture at a performance cost of just under 1%."

We explore this area by conducting two studies: identifying aspects through a listing survey ($n_1 = 80$) and gathering insights from semi-structured interviews ($n_2 = 22$). Of the 37 identified aspects, we find that supply chain mistrust and lack of automation for vulnerability management are the most challenging, and barriers to adopting platform security features include a lack of awareness and the perception that they are not necessary. Surprisingly, we find that despite being previously vulnerable, some maintainers still allow public vulnerability reporting, or ignore reports altogether. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for OSS platforms and how the research community can better support OSS vulnerability management efforts."

    "abstract": "Recently, image generation models like Stable Diffusion have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable achievements. However, their widespread use has raised concerns about potential misuse, particularly regarding acquiring training data, including using copyright-protected material. Various schemes have been proposed to address these concerns by introducing inconspicuous perturbations (poisons) to prevent models from utilizing these samples for training.\nWe present LightShed, a generalizable depoisoning attack that effectively identifies poisoned images and removes adversarial perturbations, showing the limitations of current protection schemes. LightShed exploits the wide availability of these protection schemes to generate poisoned examples and models their characteristics. The fingerprints derived from this process enable LightShed to efficiently extract and neutralize the perturbation from a protected image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LightShed against several popular perturbation-based image protection schemes, including NightShade, recently presented at IEEE S&P 2024, and Glaze, published at Usenix Security 2023. Our results show that LightShed can accurately identify poisoned samples, achieving a TPR of 99.98% and TNR of 100% on detecting NightShade and effectively depoisoning them. We show that LightShed generalizes across perturbation techniques, enabling a single model to recognize poisoned images."

This includes several protocols for multi-party third party PSI. In this model, there are multiple input parties (or clients) each holding a private set of elements and the receiver is an external party (termed as third-party) with no inputs. Multi-party third party PSI enables the receiver to learn only the intersection result of all input clients' private sets while revealing nothing else to the clients and the receiver. Our solutions include constructions that are provably secure against an arbitrary number of colluding parties in the semi-honest model. Additionally, we present protocols for third-party private set difference and private symmetric difference, whereby the learned output by the inputless third-party is the set difference and symmetric difference respectively of two other input parties, while preserving the same privacy guarantees. The motivation in the design of these protocols stems from their utilities in numerous real-world applications. We implemented our protocols and conducted experiments across various input and output set sizes."

Due to their widespread use and significant importance, Java web applications have been one prime target for cyber attacks. In this work, we propose a novel directed fuzzing approach, called WDFuzz, that can effectively vet the security of Java web applications. To achieve this, we address two main challenges: (1) efficiently exploring numerous web entries and parameters, and (2) generating structured and semantically constrained inputs. Our WDFuzz approach is two-fold. First, we develop a semantic constraint extraction technique to accurately capture the expected input structures and constraints of web parameters. Second, we implement a hierarchical scheduling strategy that evaluates the potential of each seed to trigger vulnerabilities and prioritizes the most promising seeds. In our evaluation against 15 real-world Java web applications, WDFuzz achieved a 92.6% recall rate in the known vulnerability dataset, finding 3.2 times more vulnerabilities and detecting them 7.1 times faster than the state-of-the-art web fuzzer.

The developer wants to inspect the model for potential backdoors prior to system deployment. We find that most existing detection techniques make assumptions that are not applicable to this scenario. In this paper, we present a novel framework for detecting backdoors under realistic restrictions. We generate candidate triggers by deductively searching over the space of possible triggers. We construct and optimize a smoothed version of Attack Success Rate as our search objective. Starting from a broad class of template attacks and just using the forward pass of a deep model, we reverse engineer the backdoor attack. We conduct extensive evaluation on a wide range of attacks, models, and datasets, with our technique performing almost perfectly across these settings."

    "abstract": "Artificially inflated traffic (AIT) attacks have become a prevalent threat for businesses that rely on SMS-based user verification systems: attackers use bot accounts to initiate intense volume of artificial SMS verification requests. Malicious telecommunication service providers or SMS aggregators are potential cheating entities. To date, however, there is no published literature formally characterizing AIT attacks or investigating attack detection techniques. Several online blogs provide traffic volume inspection suggestions without revealing implementation details and attack data. We bridge this gap, and for the first time formally characterize AIT attack techniques based on a large-scale dataset consisting of 9.4 million SMS request logs: our analysis reveals that attacks often use short-lived email services, and reuse common prefix values to rapidly generate unverified phone numbers and IMEI numbers. To bypass rate limit policies, bots are programmed to submit a few requests before switching to a different account, phone number or device. This distributed nature of the attack makes detection based on naive historical-event inspection extremely challenging.\nWe propose a novel AIT attack detection system that monitors such scattered attack orchestration from three different levels: machine learning features are extracted based on a single request information, multiple historical events associated with a user, phone number, or device, and country-wide suspicious traffic that has some ties to the request being inspected. A pivotal country-wide feature, for example, counts the number of distinct phone numbers associated with a given prefix value from the last 24 hour traffic. Based on this three-level feature engineering technique and a fixed threshold, we report 89.6% recall rate (false positive rate: 0.2%) on authentication requests initiated through the web client, and 91.1% recall rate (FPR: 0.1%) on the native application client traffic."
