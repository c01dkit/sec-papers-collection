    "abstract": "In 2016, law enforcement dismantled the infrastructure of the Avalanche bulletproof hosting service, the largest takedown of a cybercrime operation so far. The malware families supported by Avalanche use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to generate random domain names for controlling their botnets. The takedown proactively targets these presumably malicious domains; however, as coincidental collisions with legitimate domains are possible, investigators must first classify domains to prevent undesirable harm to website owners and botnet victims."

    "abstract": "Many wireless communications systems  found  in aircraft lack standard security mechanisms, leaving them fundamentally  vulnerable  to  attack. With  affordable software-defined radios available, a novel threat has  emerged, allowing  a  wide range of attackers to easily interfere with   wireless   avionic systems. Whilst these vulnerabilities are known, concrete attacks that exploit them are still novel and not yet well understood. This is  true  in  particular  with  regards to their  kinetic impact on the handling of the attacked aircraft and consequently its safety. To investigate this, we invited 30 Airbus A320 type-rated pilots to fly simulator scenarios in which they were subjected to attacks on their avionics. We implement and analyze novel wireless attacks on three safety-related systems: Traffic Collision Avoidance  System  (TCAS),  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System (GPWS) and the Instrument Landing System (ILS). We  found that all three analyzed attack scenarios created significant control impact and cost of disruption through turnarounds,  avoidance manoeuvres, and diversions. They further increased workload, distrust in the affected  system, and in 38% of cases caused the attacked safety system to be switched off entirely. All pilots felt the scenarios were useful, with 93.3% feeling that specific simulator training for wireless attacks could be valuable."

This approach requires a deep understanding of the target component, obtained by lengthy reverse engineering which needs to be repeated for each new component and each microarchitecture. It also does not allow for attacking shared resources that are unknown."

    "abstract": "Robocalls are inundating phone users. These automated calls allow for attackers to reach massive audiences with scams ranging from credential hijacking to unnecessary IT support in a largely untraceable fashion. In response, many applications have been developed to alert mobile phone users of incoming robocalls. However, how well these applications communicate risk with their users is not well understood.  In this paper, we identify common real-time security indicators used in the most popular anti-robocall applications.  Using focus groups and user testing, we first identify which of these indicators most effectively alert users of danger.  We then demonstrate that the most powerful indicators can reduce the likelihood that users will answer such calls by as much as 43%. Unfortunately, our evaluation also shows that attackers can eliminate the gains provided by such indicators using a small amount of target-specific information (e.g., a known phone number). In so doing, we demonstrate that anti-robocall indicators could benefit from significantly increased attention from the research community."

    "abstract": "In modern automobiles, CAN bus commands are necessary for a wide range of functionalities such as diagnosis, security monitoring, and recently autonomous driving. However, their specifications are developed privately by car manufacturers, and today the most effective way of revealing the proprietary CAN bus commands is to reverse engineer (e.g., dynamic test) with real cars, which is time consuming, costly, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective (no real car needed) and automatic (no human intervention required) approach for reverse engineering CAN bus commands using just car companion mobile apps. To achieve high effectiveness, we design a new technique to uncover the syntactics of CAN bus commands with backward slicing and dynamic forced execution, and a novel program-based algorithm to uncover the semantics of CAN bus commands by leveraging code-level semantics clues. We have implemented a prototype for both Android and iOS platforms, and tested it with all free car companion apps (253 in total) from both Google Play and Apple App Store. Among these apps, CANHUNTER discovered 182,619 syntactically unique CAN bus commands with 86% of them revealed with semantics,  covering 360 car models from 21 car manufactures. We have also evaluated their correctness (both syntactics and semantics) using public resources, cross-platform and cross-app validation, and also real-car testing, in which 70% of all the uncovered commands are validated. We observe no inconsistency in cross-platform and cross-app validation, and only discover 3 false positives (among the 241 manually validated CAN bus commands) in semantics recovery from public resources and real-car testing."

Unfortunately, due to the complex interplay between controllers, apps, and data plane inputs, at present it is difficult to systematically identify and analyze these cross-plane vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "IP address blacklists are a useful source of information about repeat attackers. Such information can be used to prioritize which traffic to divert for deeper inspection (e.g., repeat offender traffic), or which traffic to serve first (e.g., traffic from sources that are not blacklisted). But blacklists also suffer from overspecialization – each list is geared towards a specific purpose – and they may be inaccurate due to misclassification or stale information. We propose BLAG, a system that evaluates and aggregates multiple blacklists feeds, producing a more useful, accurate and timely master blacklist, tailored to the specific customer network. BLAG uses a sample of the legitimate sources of the customer network’s inbound traffic to evaluate the accuracy of each blacklist over regions of address space. It then leverages recommendation systems to select the most accurate information to aggregate into its master blacklist. Finally, BLAG identifies portions of the master blacklist that can be expanded into larger address regions (e.g. /24 prefixes) to uncover more malicious addresses with minimum collateral damage. Our evaluation of 157 blacklists of various attack types and three ground-truth datasets shows that BLAG achieves high specificity up to 99%, improves recall by up to 114 times compared to competing approaches, and detects attacks up to 13.7 days faster, which makes it a promising approach for blacklist generation."

This motivated the area of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML) where privacy of the data is guaranteed. Typically, ML techniques require large computing power, which leads clients with limited infrastructure to rely on the method of Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC). In SOC setting, the computation is outsourced to a set of specialized and powerful cloud servers and the service is availed on a pay-per-use basis. In this work, we explore PPML techniques in the SOC setting for widely used ML algorithms-- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks."

    "abstract": "With users becoming increasingly privacy-aware and browser vendors incorporating anti-tracking mechanisms, browser fingerprinting has garnered significant attention. Accordingly, prior work has proposed techniques for identifying browser extensions and using them as part of a device's fingerprint. While previous studies have demonstrated how extensions can be detected through their web accessible resources, there exists a significant gap regarding techniques that indirectly detect extensions through behavioral artifacts. In fact, no prior study has demonstrated that this can be done in an automated fashion. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting the first fully automated creation and detection of behavior-based extension fingerprints. We also introduce two novel fingerprinting techniques that monitor extensions' communication patterns, namely outgoing HTTP requests and intra-browser message exchanges. These techniques comprise the core of Carnus, a modular system for the static and dynamic analysis of extensions, which we use to create the largest set of extension fingerprints to date. We leverage our dataset of 29,428 detectable extensions to conduct a comprehensive investigation of extension fingerprinting in realistic settings and demonstrate the practicality of our attack. Our experimental evaluation against a state-of-the-art countermeasure confirms the robustness of our techniques as 87.92% of our behavior-based fingerprints remain effective."

These services typically utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform classification and detection tasks and are accessed through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Unfortunately, it is possible for an adversary to steal models from cloud-based platforms, even with black-box constraints, by repeatedly querying the public prediction API with malicious inputs. In this paper, we introduce an effective and efficient black-box attack methodology that extracts largescale DNN models from cloud-based platforms with near-perfect performance. In comparison to existing attack methods, we significantly reduce the number of queries required to steal the target model by incorporating several novel algorithms, including active learning, transfer learning, and adversarial attacks. During our experimental evaluations, we validate our proposed model for conducting theft attacks on various commercialized MLaaS platforms including two Microsoft Custom Vision APIs (Microsoft Traffic Recognition API and Microsoft Flower Recognition API), the Face++ Emotion Recognition API, the IBM Watson Visual Recognition API, Google AutoML API, and the Clarifai Safe for Work (NSFW) API. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can easily reveal/steal large-scale DNN models from these cloud platforms. Further, the proposed attack method can also be used to accurately evaluates the robustness of DNN based MLaaS image classifiers against theft attacks."

In this paper, we leverage the unique vantage point of the Internet Archive to conduct a historical and longitudinal analysis of how CSP deployment has evolved for a set of 10,000 highly ranked domains. In doing so, we document the long-term struggle site operators face when trying to roll out CSP for content restriction and highlight that even seemingly secure whitelists can be bypassed through expired or typo domains. Next to these new insights, we also shed light on the usage of CSP for other use cases, in particular, TLS enforcement and framing control. Here, we find that CSP can be easily deployed to fit those security scenarios, but both lack wide-spread adoption. Specifically, while the underspecified and thus inconsistently implemented X-Frame-Options header is increasingly used on the Web, CSP's well-specified and secure alternative cannot keep up. To understand the reasons behind this, we run a notification campaign and subsequent survey, concluding that operators have often experienced the complexity of CSP (and given up), utterly unaware of the easy-to-deploy components of CSP. Hence, we find the complexity of secure, yet functional content restriction gives CSP a bad reputation, resulting in operators not leveraging its potential to secure a site against the non-original attack vectors."

Furthermore, we propose a k-hop greedy matching algorithm to find the optimal diffing results using the generated block embeddings.

The results show that our tool could outperform the state-of-the-art binary diffing tools by a large margin for both cross-version and cross-optimization level diffing.

We show that settling for de facto ownership is sufficient for protecting against hazardous prefix hijacking and can be accomplished without requiring any changes to today's routing infrastructure. We present APKI, a readily deployable system that automatically certifies de facto ownership and generates the appropriate BGP-path-filtering rules at routers. We evaluate APKI's security and deployability via live experiments on the Internet using a prototype implementation of APKI and through simulations on empirically-derived datasets. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we open source our prototype, simulator, and measurement analysis code."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of dynamic searchable encryption (DSE) with forward-and-backward privacy. Many DSE schemes have been proposed recently but the most efficient ones have one limitation: they require maintaining an operation counter for each unique keyword, either stored locally at the client or accessed obliviously (e.g., with an oblivious map) at the server, during  every operation. We propose three new schemes that overcome the above limitation and achieve constant permanent client storage with improved performance, both asymptotically and  experimentally, compared to prior state-of-the-art works. In particular, our first two schemes  adopt a \"static-to-dynamic\" transformation which eliminates the need for oblivious  accesses during searches. Due to this, they are the first practical schemes with minimal client storage and non-interactive search. Our third scheme is the first quasi-optimal forward-and-backward  DSE scheme with only a logarithmic overhead for retrieving the query result (independently of previous deletions). While it does require an oblivious access during search in order to keep  permanent client storage minimal, its practical performance is up to four orders of magnitude  better than the best existing scheme with quasi-optimal search."

    "paper": "https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/easi-edge-based-sender-identification-on-resource-constrained-platforms-for-automotive-networks/",
    "abstract": "In vehicles, internal Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are increasingly prone to adversarial exploitation over wireless connections due to ongoing digitalization. Controlling an ECU allows an adversary to send messages to the internal vehicle bus and thereby to control various vehicle functions. Access to the Controller Area Network (CAN), the most widely used bus technology, is especially severe as it controls brakes and steering. However, state of the art receivers are not able to identify the sender of a frame. Retrofitting frame authenticity, e.g. through Message Authentication Codes (MACs), is only possible to a limited extent due to reduced bandwidth, low payload and limited computational resources. To address this problem, observation in analog differences of the CAN signal was proposed to determine the actual sender. These prior approaches, which exhibit good identification rates in some cases, require high sample rates and a high computational effort. With EASI we significantly reduce the required resources and at the same time show increased identification rates of 99.98% by having no false positives in a prototype structure and two series production vehicles. In comparison to the most lightweight approach so far, we have reduced the memory footprint and the computational requirements by a factor of 168 and 142, respectively. In addition, we show the feasibility of EASI and thus for the first time that sender identification is realizable using comprehensive signal characteristics on resource-constrained platforms. Due to the lightweight design, we achieved a classification in under 100,$mu$s with a training time of 2.61 seconds. We also showed the ability to adapt the system to incremental changes during operation. Since cost effectiveness is of utmost importance in the automotive industry due to high production volumes, the achieved improvements are significant and necessary to realize sender identification."

    "abstract": "Virtually every connection to an Internet service is preceded by a DNS lookup which is performed without any traffic-level protection, thus enabling manipulation, redirection, surveillance, and censorship. To address these issues, large organizations such as Google and Cloudflare are deploying recently standardized protocols that encrypt DNS traffic between end users and recursive resolvers such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). In this paper, we examine whether encrypting DNS traffic can protect users from traffic analysis-based monitoring and censoring. We propose a novel feature set to perform the attacks, as those used to attack HTTPS or Tor traffic are not suitable for DNS’ characteristics. We show that traffic analysis enables the identification of domains with high accuracy in closed and open world settings, using 124 times less data than attacks on HTTPS flows. We find that factors such as location, resolver, platform, or client do mitigate the attacks performance but they are far from completely stopping them. Our results indicate that DNS-based censorship is still possible on encrypted DNS traffic. In fact, we demonstrate that the standardized padding schemes are not effective. Yet, Tor — which does not effectively mitigate traffic analysis attacks on web traffic— is a good defense against DoH traffic analysis."

This bug evolves into an Unrestricted Executable File Upload (UEFU) vulnerability when the adversary is able to conduct remote code execution of the uploaded file via triggering its URL. We design and implement FUSE, the first penetration testing tool designed to discover UFU and UEFU vulnerabilities in server-side PHP web applications. The goal of FUSE is to generate upload requests; each request becomes an exploit payload that triggers a UFU or UEFU vulnerability. However, this approach entails two technical challenges: (1) it should generate an upload request that bypasses all content-filtering checks present in a target web application; and (2) it should preserve the execution semantic of the resulting uploaded file. We address these technical challenges by mutating standard upload requests with carefully designed mutation operations that enable the bypassing of content- filtering checks and do not tamper with the execution of uploaded files. FUSE discovered 30 previously unreported UEFU vulnerabilities, including 15 CVEs from 33 real-world web applications, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in finding code execution bugs via file uploads."

    "abstract": "Here, we evaluate the security of a consumer-facing, third party genetic analysis service, called GEDmatch, that specializes in genetic genealogy: a field that uses genetic data to identify relatives. GEDmatch is one of the most prominent third-party genetic genealogy services due to its size (over 1 million genetic data files) and the large role it now plays in criminal investigations. In this work, we focus on security risks particular to genetic genealogy, namely relative matching queries -- the algorithms used to identify genetic relatives -- and the resulting relative predictions. We experimentally demonstrate that GEDmatch is vulnerable to a number of attacks by an adversary that only uploads normally formatted genetic data files and runs relative matching queries. Using a small number of specifically designed files and queries, an attacker can extract a large percentage of the genetic markers from other users; 92% of markers can be extracted with 98% accuracy, including hundreds of medically sensitive markers. We also find that an adversary can construct genetic data files that falsely appear like relatives to other samples in the database; in certain situations, these false relatives can be used to make the de-identification of genetic data more difficult. These vulnerabilities exist because of particular design choices meant to improve functionality. However, our results show how security and the goals of genetic genealogy can come in conflict. We conclude with a discussion of the broader impact of these results to the entire consumer genetic testing community and provide recommendations for genetic genealogy services."

However, we observe that applying hybrid fuzzing to kernel testing is challenging because the following unique characteristics of the kernel make a naive adoption of hybrid fuzzing inefficient: 1) having many implicit control transfers determined by syscall arguments, 2) controlling and matching internal system state via system calls, and 3) inferring nested argument type for invoking system calls. Failure to handling such challenges will render both fuzzing and symbolic execution inefficient, and thereby, will result in an inefficient hybrid fuzzing. Although these challenges are essential to both fuzzing and symbolic execution, however, to the best of our knowledge, existing kernel testing approaches either naively use each technique separately without handling such challenges or imprecisely handle a part of challenges only by static analysis."

    "paper": "https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/hold-the-door-fingerprinting-your-car-key-to-prevent-keyless-entry-car-theft/",
    "abstract": "Recently, the traditional way to unlock car doors has been replaced with a keyless entry system which proves more convenient for automobile owners. When a driver with a key fob is in vicinity of the vehicle, doors automatically unlock on user command. However, unfortunately, it has been known that these keyless entry systems are vulnerable to signal-relaying attacks. While it is evident that automobile manufacturers incorporate preventative methods to secure these keyless entry systems, a range of attacks continue to occur. Relayed signals fit into the valid packets that are verified as legitimate, and this makes it is difficult to distinguish a legitimate request for doors to be unlocked from malicious signals. In response to this vulnerability, this paper presents an RF-fingerprinting method (coined “HOld the DOoR”, HODOR) to detect attacks on keyless entry systems, which is the first attempt to exploit RF-fingerprint technique in automotive domain. HODOR is designed as a sub-authentication system that supports existing authentication systems for keyless entry systems and does not require any modification of the main system to perform. Through a series of experiments, the results demonstrate that HODOR competently and reliably detects attacks on keyless entry systems. HODOR achieves both an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.27% with a false negative rate (FNR) of 0% for the detection of simulated attacks corresponding to the current issue on keyless entry car theft. Furthermore, HODOR was also observed under environmental factors: temperature variation, non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions and battery aging. HODOR yields a false positive rate of 1.32% for the identification of a legitimated key fob which is even under NLoS condition. Based on the experimental results, it is expected that HODOR will provide a secure service for keyless entry systems, while remaining convenient."

The threat intelligence provided by IM communication, therefore, becomes invaluable for understanding and mitigating the threats of e-commerce frauds.

In this paper, we present the first chatbot, called  Aubrey, to actively collect such intelligence through autonomous chats with real-world e-commerce miscreants. Our approach leverages the question-driven conversation pattern of small-time workers, who seek from e-commerce fraudsters jobs and/or attack resources, to model the interaction process as a finite state machine, thereby enabling an autonomous conversation. Aubrey successfully chatted with 470 real-world e-commerce miscreants and gathered a large amount of fraud-related artifact, including 40 SIM gateways, 323K fraud phone numbers, and previously-unknown attack toolkits, etc. Further, the conversations reveal the supply chain of e-commerce fraudulent activities on the deep web and the complicated relations (e.g., complicity and reselling) among miscreant roles."

    "abstract": "Motion sensors on current smartphones have been exploited for audio eavesdropping due to their sensitivity to vibrations. However, this threat is considered low-risk because of two widely acknowledged limitations: First, unlike microphones, motion sensors can only pick up speech signals traveling through a solid medium. Thus the only feasible setup reported previously is to use a smartphone gyroscope to eavesdrop on a loudspeaker placed on the same table. The second limitation comes from a common sense that these sensors can only pick up a narrow band (85-100Hz) of speech signals due to a sampling ceiling of 200Hz. In this paper, we revisit the threat of motion sensors to speech privacy and propose AccelEve, a new side-channel attack that employs a smartphone's accelerometer to eavesdrop on the speaker in the same smartphone. Specifically, it utilizes the accelerometer measurements to recognize the speech emitted by the speaker and to reconstruct the corresponding audio signals. In contrast to previous works, our setup allows the speech signals to always produce strong responses in accelerometer measurements through the shared motherboard, which successfully addresses the first limitation and allows this kind of attacks to penetrate into real-life scenarios. Regarding the sampling rate limitation, contrary to the widely-held belief, we observe up to 500Hz sampling rates in recent smartphones, which almost covers the entire fundamental frequency band (85-255Hz) of adult speech. On top of these pivotal observations, we propose a novel deep learning based system that learns to recognize and reconstruct speech information from the spectrogram representation of acceleration signals. This system employs adaptive optimization on deep neural networks with skip connections using robust and generalizable losses to achieve robust recognition and reconstruction performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our attack under various settings."

In this study, we refer to these services as web rehosting services and make the first exploration of their security flaws. The web rehosting services use a single domain name to rehost several websites that have distinct domain names; this characteristic makes web rehosting services intrinsically vulnerable to violating the same origin policy if not operated carefully. Based on the intrinsic vulnerability of web rehosting services, we demonstrate that an attacker can perform five different types of attacks that target users who make use of web rehosting services: persistent man-in-the-middle attack, abusing privileges to access various resources, stealing credentials, stealing browser history, and session hijacking/injection. Our extensive analysis of 21 popular web rehosting services, which have more than 200 million visits per day, revealed that these attacks are feasible.

The key challenge stems from how to ensure the added perturbation of the original audio in advance at the sender side is immune to unknown signal distortions during the transmission process. Our empirical study reveals that signal distortion is mainly due to device and channel frequency selectivity but with different characteristics. This brings a chance to capture and further pre-code this impact to generate adversarial examples that are robust to the over-the-air transmission. We leverage this opportunity in Metamorph and obtain an initial perturbation that captures the core distortion's impact from only a small set of prior measurements, and then take advantage of a domain adaptation algorithm to refine the perturbation to further improve the attack distance and reliability. Moreover, we consider also reducing human perceptibility of the added perturbation. Evaluation achieves a high attack success rate (95%) over the attack distance of up to 6 m. Within a moderate distance, e.g., 3 m, Metamorph maintains a high success rate (98%), yet can be further adapted to largely improve the audio quality, confirmed by a human perceptibility study."

The scripting engines optimize performance via just-in-time compilation. Since applications are increasingly hardened against code-reuse attacks, adversaries are looking to achieve code execution or elevate privileges by corrupting sensitive data like the intermediate representation of optimizing JIT compilers. This has inspired numerous defenses for just-in-time compilers."

    "abstract": "Coverage-based fuzzing has been actively studied and widely adopted for finding vulnerabilities in real-world software applications. With code coverage, such as statement coverage and transition coverage, as the guidance of input mutation, coverage-based fuzzing can generate inputs that cover more code and thus find more vulnerabilities without prerequisite information such as input format. Current coverage-based fuzzing tools treat covered code equally. All inputs that contribute to new statements or transitions are kept for future mutation no matter what the statements or transitions are and how much they impact security. Although this design is reasonable from the perspective of software testing, which aims to full code coverage, it is inefficient for vulnerability discovery since that 1) current techniques are still inadequate to reach full coverage within a reasonable amount of time, and that 2) we always want to discover vulnerabilities early so that it can be patched promptly. Even worse, due to the non-discriminative code coverage treatment, current fuzzing tools suffer from recent anti-fuzzing techniques and become much less effective in finding real-world vulnerabilities."

    "paper": "https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/oculock-exploring-human-visual-system-for-authentication-in-virtual-reality-head-mounted-display/",
    "abstract": "The increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) in a wide spectrum of applications has generated sensitive personal data such as medical records and credit card information. While protecting such data from unauthorized access is critical, directly applying traditional authentication methods (e.g., PIN) through new VR input modalities such as remote controllers and head navigation would cause security issues. The authentication action can be purposefully observed by attackers to infer the authentication input. Unlike any other mobile devices, VR presents immersive experience via a head-mounted display (HMD) that fully covers users' eye area without public exposure. Leveraging this feature, we explore human visual system (HVS) as a novel biometric authentication tailored for VR platforms. While previous works used eye globe movement (gaze) to authenticate smartphones or PCs, they suffer from a high error rate and low stability since eye gaze is highly dependent on cognitive states. In this paper, we explore the HVS as a whole to consider not just the eye globe movement but also the eyelid, extraocular muscles, cells, and surrounding nerves in the HVS. Exploring HVS biostructure and unique HVS features triggered by immersive VR content can enhance authentication stability. To this end, we present OcuLock, an HVS-based system for reliable and unobservable VR HMD authentication. OcuLock is empowered by an electrooculography (EOG) based HVS sensing framework and a record-comparison driven authentication scheme. Experiments through 70 subjects show that OcuLock is resistant against common types of attacks such as impersonation attack and statistical attack with Equal Error Rates as low as 3.55% and 4.97% respectively. More importantly, OcuLock maintains a stable performance over a 2-month period and is preferred by users when compared to other potential approaches."

    "abstract": "We assess the security of machine learning based biometric authentication systems against an attacker who submits uniform random inputs, either as feature vectors or raw inputs, in order to find an emph{accepting sample} of a target user. The average false positive rate (FPR) of the system, i.e., the rate at which an impostor is incorrectly accepted as the legitimate user, may be interpreted as a measure of the success probability of such an attack. However, we show that the success rate is often higher than the FPR. In particular, for one reconstructed biometric system with an average FPR of 0.03, the success rate was as high as 0.78. This has implications for the security of the system, as an attacker with only the knowledge of the length of the feature space can impersonate the user with less than 2 attempts on average. We provide detailed analysis of why the attack is successful, and validate our results using four different biometric modalities and four different machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose mitigation techniques that render such attacks ineffective, with little to no effect on the accuracy of the system."

    "abstract": "Cache conflicts due to deterministic memory-to-cache mapping have long been exploited to leak sensitive information such as secret keys. While randomized mapping is fully investigated for L1 caches, it still remains unresolved about how to secure a much larger last-level cache (LLC). Recent solutions periodically change the mapping strategy to disrupt the crafting of conflicted addresses, which is a critical attack procedure to exploit cache conflicts. Remapping, however, increases both miss rate and access latency. We present PhantomCache for securing an LLC with remapping-free randomized mapping. We propose a localized randomization technique to bound randomized mapping of a memory address within only a limited number of cache sets. The small randomization space offers fast set search over an LLC in a memory access. The intrinsic randomness still suffices to obfuscate conflicts and disrupt efficient exploitation of conflicted addresses. We evaluate PhantomCache against an attacker exploring the state-of-the-art attack with linear-complexity. To secure an 8-bank 16~MB 16-way LLC, PhantomCache confines randomization space of an address within 8 sets and brings only 0.5% performance degradation and 0.5% storage overhead per cache line, which are 3x and 9x more efficient than the state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, PhantomCache is solely an architectural solution and requires no software change."

    "abstract": "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become a critical threat to the Internet. Due to the increasing number of vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, attackers can easily compromise a large set of nodes and launch highvolume DDoS attacks from the botnets. State-of-the-art DDoS defenses, however, have not caught up with the fast development of the attacks. Middlebox-based defenses can achieve high performance with specialized hardware; however, these defenses incur a high cost, and deploying new defenses typically requires a device upgrade. On the other hand, software-based defenses are highly flexible, but software-based packet processing leads to high performance overheads. In this paper, we propose Poseidon, a system that addresses these limitations in today’s DDoS defenses. It leverages emerging programmable switches, which can be reconfigured in the field without additional hardware upgrade. Users of Poseidon can specify their defense strategies in a modular fashion in the form of a set of defense primitives; this can be further customized easily for each network and extended to include new defenses. Poseidon then maps the defense primitives to run on programmable switches—and when necessary, on server software—for effective defense. When attacks change, Poseidon can reconfigure the underlying defense primitives to respond to the new attack patterns. Evaluations using our prototype demonstrate that Poseidon can effectively defend against highvolume attacks, easily support customization of defense strategies, and adapt to dynamic attacks with low overheads."

    "abstract": "The potential development of large-scale quantum computers is raising concerns among IT and security research professionals due to their ability to solve (elliptic curve) discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems in polynomial time. There is, therefore, a threat to public-key cryptography as all the currently used algorithms would be deemed insecure in a post-quantum (PQ) setting. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a process to standardize quantum-resistant crypto algorithms, focusing primarily on their security guarantees. Since PQ algorithms present significant differences over classical ones, their overall assessment should not be performed out-of-context. This work presents a detailed performance evaluation of the NIST signature algorithm candidates and investigates the imposed latency on TLS 1.3 connection establishment under realistic network conditions. In addition, we investigate their impact on the achievable TLS session throughput of a server and analyze the trade-off between lengthier PQ signatures, and computationally heavier PQ cryptographic operations for idle and heavily loaded servers. Our results demonstrate that the adoption of at least two PQ signature algorithms would indeed be viable for time-sensitive applications over TLS with little additional overhead over current signature algorithms. Also, we argue that more of the NIST PQ candidates can effectively be used for less time-sensitive applications, and provide an in-depth discussion on the integration of PQ authentication in encrypted tunneling protocols, along with the related challenges, and alternatives. Finally, we propose and evaluate the combination of different PQ signature algorithms across the same certificate chain in TLS. Results show a reduction of the TLS handshake time and a significant increase of a server's TLS tunnel connection rate over the alternative of the chain using a single PQ signature scheme."

In this paper, we show that despite the use of advanced encryption, popular IM applications leak sensitive information about their clients to adversaries who merely monitor their encrypted IM traffic, with no need for leveraging any software vulnerabilities of IM applications. Specifically, we devise traffic analysis attacks that enable an adversary to identify  administrators as well as  members of target IM channels (e.g., forums) with  high accuracies. We believe that our study demonstrates  a significant, real-world threat to the users of such services given the increasing attempts by oppressive governments at cracking down controversial IM channels."

On the other hand, a public report of a bug with a security impact is a powerful first step towards exploitation. Adversaries may exploit such bugs to launch devastating attacks if defenders do not fix them promptly.  Common practice is for maintainers to assess the security impacts of bugs manually, but the scaling and reliability challenges of manual analysis lead to missed vulnerabilities."

Recently, researchers have demonstrated that these voice assistant systems are susceptible to signal injection from voice commands at the inaudible frequency. To date, most of the existing work focus primarily on delivering a single command via line-of-sight ultrasound speaker and extending the range of this attack via speaker array. However, sound waves also propagate through other materials where vibration is possible. In this work, we aim to understand the characteristics of this new genre of attack in the context of different transmission media. Furthermore, by leveraging the unique properties of acoustic transmission in solid materials, we design a new attack called SurfingAttack that will allow multiple rounds of interactions with the voice-controlled device over a longer distance and without the need to be in line-of-sight, resulting in minimal change to the physical environment. This has greatly elevated the potential risk of inaudible sound attack, enabling many new attack scenarios, such as hijacking a mobile Short Message Service (SMS) passcode, making ghost fraud calls without owners' knowledge, etc. To accomplish SurfingAttack, we have solved several major challenges. First, the signal has been specially designed to allow omni-directional transmission for performing effective attacks over a solid medium. Second, the new attack enables two-way communication without alerting the legitimate user at the scene, which is challenging since the device is designed to interact with human in physical proximity rather than sensors. To mitigate this newly discovered threat, we also provide discussions and experimental results on potential countermeasures to defend against this new threat."

With the notion of destination-driven reachability and packet-carrying forwarding state, SVLAN not only offers communication isolation but isolation can be specified at different granularities, e.g., per-application or per-process.

    "abstract": "A key characteristic of commonly deployed deep packet inspection (DPI) systems is that they implement a simpli- fied state machine of the network stack that often differs from that of the end hosts. The discrepancies between the two state machines have been exploited to bypass such DPI middleboxes. However, most prior approaches to do so rely on manually crafted adversarial packets, which not only is labor-intensive but may not work well across a plurality of DPI-based middleboxes. Our goal in this work is to develop an automated way to craft such candidate packets, targeting TCP implementations in particular. Our approach to achieve this goal hinges on the key insight that while the TCP state machines of DPI implementations are obscure, those of the end hosts are well established. Thus, in our system SYMTCP, using symbolic execution, we systematically explore the TCP implementation of an end host, identifying candidate packets that can reach critical points in the code (e.g., which causes the packets to be accepted or dropped/ignored); such automatically identified packets are then fed through the DPI middlebox to determine if a discrepancy is induced and the middlebox can be bypassed. We find that our approach is extremely effective. It can generate tens of thousands of candidate adversarial packets in less than an hour. When evaluating against multiple state-of-the-art DPI middleboxes such as Zeek and Snort, as well as a state-level censorship firewall, Great Firewall of China, we identify not only previously known evasion strategies, but also novel ones that were never previously reported (e.g., involving urgent pointer). The system can extend easily to test other combinations of operating systems and DPI middleboxes, and serve as a valuable testing tool of future DPIs’ robustness against evasion attempts."

As a result, users are left with insufficient details when granting sensitive data to these applications."

    "paper": "https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/towards-plausible-graph-anonymization/",
    "abstract": "Social graphs derived from online social interactions contain a wealth of information that is nowadays extensively used by both industry and academia. However, as social graphs contain sensitive information, they need to be properly anonymized before release. Most of the existing graph anonymization mechanisms rely on the perturbation of the original graph’s edge set. In this paper, we identify a fundamental weakness of these mechanisms: They neglect the strong structural proximity between friends in social graphs, thus add implausible fake edges for anonymization.\nTo exploit this weakness, we first propose a metric to quantify an edge’s plausibility by relying on graph embedding. Extensive experiments on three real-life social network datasets demonstrate that our plausibility metric can very effectively differentiate fake edges from original edges with AUC values above 0.95 in most of the cases. We then rely on a Gaussian mixture model to automatically derive the threshold on the edge plausibility values to determine whether an edge is fake, which enables us to recover to a large extent the original graph from the anonymized graph. Then, we demonstrate that our graph recovery attack jeopardizes the privacy guarantees provided by the considered graph anonymization mechanisms.\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a method to generate fake yet plausible edges given the graph structure and incorporate it into the existing anonymization mechanisms. Our evaluation demonstrates that the enhanced mechanisms decrease the chances of graph recovery, reduce the success of graph de-anonymization (up to 30%), and provide even better utility than the existing anonymization mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Existing attack investigation solutions for GUI applications suffer from a few limitations such as inaccuracy (because of the dependence explosion problem), requiring instrumentation, and providing very low visibility. Such limitations have hindered their widespread and practical deployment. In this paper, we present UIScope, a novel accurate, instrumentation-free, and visible attack investigation system for GUI applications. The core idea of UIScope is to perform causality analysis on both UI elements/events which represent users' perspective and low-level system events which provide detailed information of what happens under the hood, and then correlate system events with UI events to provide high accuracy and visibility. Long running processes are partitioned to individual UI transitions, to which low-level system events are attributed, making the results accurate. The produced graphs contain (causally related) UI elements with which users are very familiar, making them easily accessible. We deployed UIScope on 7 machines for a week, and also utilized UIScope to conduct an investigation of 6 real-world attacks. Our evaluation shows that compared to existing works, UIScope introduces negligible overhead (less than 1% runtime overhead and 3.05 MB event logs per hour on average) while UIScope can precisely identify attack provenance while offering users thorough visibility into the attack context."

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are difficult to detect due to their “low-and-slow” attack patterns and frequent use of zero-day exploits. We present UNICORN, an anomaly-based APT detector that effectively leverages data provenance analysis. From modeling to detection, UNICORN tailors its design specifically for the unique characteristics of APTs. Through extensive yet time-efficient graph analysis, UNICORN explores provenance graphs that provide rich contextual and historical information to identify stealthy anomalous activities without pre-defined attack signatures. Using a graph sketching technique, it summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency to combat slow-acting attacks that take place over a long time span. UNICORN further improves its detection capability using a novel modeling approach to understand long-term behavior as the system evolves. Our evaluation shows that UNICORN outperforms an existing state-of-the-art APT detection system and detects real-life APT scenarios with high accuracy."

In order to foil the analysis of anti-malware systems and evade detection, malware uses packing and other forms of obfuscation. However, few realize that benign applications use packing and obfuscation as well, to protect intellectual property and prevent license abuse."

    "paper": "https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/when-match-fields-do-not-need-to-match-buffered-packets-hijacking-in-sdn/",
    "abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) greatly meets the need in industry for programmable, agile, and dynamic networks by deploying diversified SDN applications on a centralized controller. However, SDN application ecosystem inevitably introduces new security threats since compromised or malicious applications can significantly disrupt network operations. A number of effective security enhancement systems have been developed to defend against potential attacks from SDN applications, including data provenance systems to protect applications from being poisoned by malicious applications, rule conflict detection systems to prevent data packets from bypassing network security policies, and application isolation systems to prevent applications from corrupting controllers. In this paper, we identify a new design flaw on flow rule installation in SDN, and this vulnerability can be exploited by malicious applications to launch effective attacks bypassing existing defense systems. We discover that SDN systems do not check the inconsistency between the buffer ID and match fields when an application attempts to install flow rules, so that a malicious application can manipulate the buffer ID to hijack buffered packets even though the installed flow rule from the application does not match the packet with that buffer ID. We name this new vulnerability as *buffered packet hijacking*, which can be exploited to launch attacks that disrupt all three SDN layers, namely, application layer, data plane layer, and control layer. First, by modifying buffered packets and resending them to controllers, a malicious application can poison other applications. Second, by manipulating forwarding behaviors of buffered packets, a malicious application can not only disrupt TCP connections of flows but also make flows bypass network security policies. Third, by copying massive buffered packets to controllers, a malicious application can saturate the bandwidth of the SDN control channel and computing resources. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these attacks with both theoretical analysis and experiments in a real SDN testbed. Finally, we develop a lightweight defense system that can be readily deployed in existing SDN controllers as a patch."

    "abstract": "The security of the Internet's routing infrastructure has underpinned much of the past two decades of distributed systems security research. However, the converse is increasingly true. Routing and path decisions are now important for the security properties of systems built on top of the Internet. In particular, BGP poisoning leverages the de facto routing protocol between Autonomous Systems (ASes) to maneuver the return paths of upstream networks onto previously unusable, new paths. These new paths can be used to avoid congestion, censors, geo-political boundaries, or any feature of the topology which can be expressed at an AS-level. Given the increase in use of BGP poisoning as a security primitive for security systems, we set out to evaluate the feasibility of poisoning in practice, going beyond simulation."

    "abstract": "To subvert recent advances in perimeter and host security, the attacker community has developed and employed various attack vectors to make a malware much more stealthy than before to penetrate the target system and prolong its presence. The advanced malware, or stealthy malware, impersonates or abuses benign applications and legitimate system tools to minimize its footprints in the target system. One example of such stealthy malware is fileless malware, which resides its malicious logic mostly in the memory of well-trusted processes. It is difficult for traditional detection tools, such as malware scanners, to detect it, as the malware normally does not expose its malicious payload in a file and hides its malicious behaviors among the benign behaviors of the processes."

Microcontroller-based systems (MCUS) are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of limited resources and low level programming which leads to bugs.

For example, exploiting a WiFi System on Chip (SoC) allows an attacker to hijack the smart phone's application processor."
