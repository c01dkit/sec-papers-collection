    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402047",
    "abstract": "Reliable cost effective effort estimation remains a considerable challenge for software projects. Recent work has demonstrated that the popular Planning Poker practice can produce reliable estimates when undertaken within a software team of knowledgeable domain experts. However, the process depends on the availability of experts and can be time-consuming to perform, making it impractical for large scale or open source projects that may curate many thousands of outstanding tasks. This paper reports on a full study to investigate the feasibility of using crowd workers supplied with limited information about a task to provide comparably accurate estimates using Planning Poker. We describe the design of a Crowd Planning Poker (CPP) process implemented on Amazon Mechanical Turk and the results of a substantial set of trials, involving more than 5000 crowd workers and 39 diverse software tasks. Our results show that a carefully organised and selected crowd of workers can produce effort estimates that are of similar accuracy to those of a single expert.",

    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402086",
    "abstract": "Modern programming follows the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) approach rather than the traditional waterfall model. Even the development of modern programming languages uses the CI/CD approach to swiftly provide new language features and to adapt to new development environments. Unlike in the conventional approach, in the modern CI/CD approach, a language specification is no more the oracle of the language semantics because both the specification and its implementations (interpreters or compilers) can co-evolve. In this setting, both the specification and implementations may have bugs, and guaranteeing their correctness is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a novel N+1-versiondifferentialtesting to resolve the problem. Unlike the traditional differential testing, our approach consists of three steps: (1) to automatically synthesize programs guided by the syntax and semantics from a given language specification, (2) to generate conformance tests by injecting assertions to the synthesized programs to check their final program states, (3) to detect bugs in the specification and implementations via executing the conformance tests on multiple implementations and (4) to localize bugs on the specification using statistical information. We actualize our approach for the JavaScript programming language via JEST, which performs N+1-version differential testing for modern JavaScript engines and ECMAScript, the language specification describing the syntax and semantics of JavaScript in a natural language. We evaluated JEST with four JavaScript engines that support all modern JavaScript language features and the latest version of ECMAScript (ES11, 2020). JEST automatically synthesized 1,700 programs that covered 97.78% of syntax and 87.70% of semantics from ES11. Using the assertion-injected JavaScript programs, it detected 44 engine bugs in four different engines and 27 specification bugs in ES11.",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402008",
    "abstract": "One of the main challenges of reactive synthesis, an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system, is to deal with unrealizable specifications. One means to deal with unrealizability, in the context of GR(1), an expressive assume-guarantee fragment of LTL that enables efficient synthesis, is the computation of an unrealizable core, which can be viewed as a fault-localization approach. Existing solutions, however, are computationally costly, are limited to computing a single core, and do not correctly support specifications with constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements. In this work we address these limitations. First, we present QuickCore, a novel algorithm that accelerates unrealizable core computations by relying on the monotonicity of unrealizability, on an incremental computation, and on additional properties of GR(1) specifications. Second, we present Punch, a novel algorithm to efficiently compute all unrealizable cores of a specification. Finally, we present means to correctly handle specifications that include higher-level constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements. We implemented our ideas on top of Spectra, an open-source language and synthesis environment. Our evaluation over benchmarks from the literature shows that QuickCore is in most cases faster than previous algorithms, and that its relative advantage grows with scale. Moreover, we found that most specifications include more than one core, and that Punch finds all the cores significantly faster than a competing naive algorithm.",

    "abstract": "When a program is nondeterministic, it is difficult to test and debug. Nondeterminism occurs even in sequential programs: e.g., by iterating over the elements of a hash table. We have created a type system that expresses determinism specifications in a program. The key ideas in the type system are type qualifiers for nondeterminism, order-nondeterminism, and determinism; type well-formedness rules to restrict collection types; and enhancements to polymorphism that improve precision when analyzing collection operations. While state of-the-art nondeterminism detection tools rely on observing output from specific runs, our approach soundly verifies determinism at compile time. We implemented our type system for Java. Our type checker, the Determinism Checker, warns if a program is nondeterministic or verifies that the program is deterministic. In case studies of 90097 lines of code, the Determinism Checker found 87 previously-unknown nondeterminism errors, even in programs that had been heavily vetted by developers who were greatly concerned about nondeterminism errors. In experiments, the Determinism Checker found all of the non-concurrency-related nondeterminism that was found by state-of-the-art dynamic approaches for detecting flaky tests.",

Library users may write code that relies on a specific implementation rather than on the specification, e.g., assuming mistakenly that the order of elements cannot change in the future. Prior work proposed the NonDex approach that detects such wrong assumptions. We present a novel approach, called DexFix, to repair wrong assumptions on underdetermined specifications in an automated way. We run the NonDex tool on 200 open-source Java projects and detect 275 tests that fail due to wrong assumptions. The majority of failures are from iterating over HashMap/HashSet collections and the getDeclaredFields method. We provide several new repair strategies that can fix these violations in both the test code and the main code. DexFix proposes fixes for 119 tests from the detected 275 tests. We have already reported fixes for 102 tests as GitHub pull requests: 74 have been merged, with only 5 rejected, and the remaining pending.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of annotations in Java 5, the majority of testing frameworks, such as JUnit, TestNG, and Mockito, have adopted annotations in their core design. This adoption affected the testing practices in every step of the test life-cycle, from fixture setup and test execution to fixture teardown. Despite the importance of test annotations, most research on test maintenance has mainly focused on test code quality and test assertions. As a result, there is little empirical evidence on the evolution and maintenance of test annotations. To fill this gap, we perform the first fine-grained empirical study on annotation changes. We developed a tool to mine 82,810 commits and detect 23,936 instances of test annotation changes from 12 open-source Java projects. Our main findings are: (1) Test annotation changes are more frequent than rename and type change refactorings. (2) We recover various migration efforts within the same testing framework or between different frameworks by analyzing common annotation replacement patterns. (3) We create a taxonomy by manually inspecting and classifying a sample of 368 test annotation changes and documenting the motivations driving these changes. Finally, we present a list of actionable implications for developers, researchers, and framework designers.",

    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402106",
    "abstract": "JavaScript libraries are often updated and sometimes breaking changes are introduced in the process, resulting in the client developers having to adapt their code to the changes. In addition to locating the affected parts of their code, the client developers must apply suitable patches, which is a tedious, error-prone, and entirely manual process. To reduce the manual effort, we present JSFIX. Given a collection of semantic patches, which are formalized descriptions of the breaking changes, the tool detects the locations affected by breaking changes and then transforms those parts of the code to become compatible with the new library version. JSFIX relies on an existing static analysis to approximate the set of affected locations, and an interactive process where the user answers questions about the client code to filter away false positives. An evaluation involving 12 popular JavaScript libraries and 203 clients shows that our notion of semantic patches can accurately express most of the breaking changes that occur in practice, and that JSFIX can successfully adapt most of the clients to the changes. In particular, 31 clients have accepted pull requests made by JSFIX, indicating that the code quality is good enough for practical usage. It takes JSFIX only a few seconds to patch, on average, 3.8 source locations affected by breaking changes in each client, with only 2.7 questions to the user, which suggests that the approach can significantly reduce the manual effort required when adapting JavaScript programs to evolving libraries.",

There has been much research on addressing detecting incompatible changes in libraries, or helping applications co-evolve with the libraries. The existing solution helps the latest application version work well against the latest library version as an afterthought. However, end users have already been suffering from the failures and have to wait for new versions. In this paper, we propose DepOwl, a practical tool helping users prevent compatibility failures. The key idea is to avoid using incompatible versions from the very beginning. We evaluated DepOwl on 38 known compatibility failures from StackOverflow, and DepOwl can prevent 35 of them. We also evaluated DepOwl using the software repository shipped with Ubuntu-19.10. DepOwl detected 77 unknown dependency bugs, which may lead to compatibility failures.",

    "abstract": "Ever since its first release in 2009, the Go programming language (Golang) has been well received by software communities. A major reason for its success is the powerful support of library-based development, where a Golang project can be conveniently built on top of other projects by referencing them as libraries. As Golang evolves, it recommends the use of a new library-referencing mode to overcome the limitations of the original one. While these two library modes are incompatible, both are supported by the Golang ecosystem. The heterogeneous use of library-referencing modes across Golang projects has caused numerous dependency management (DM) issues, incurring reference inconsistencies and even build failures. Motivated by the problem, we conducted an empirical study to characterize the DM issues, understand their root causes, and examine their fixing solutions. Based on our findings, we developed Hero, an automated technique to detect DM issues and suggest proper fixing solutions. We applied Hero to 19,000 popular Golang projects. The results showed that Hero achieved a high detection rate of 98.5% on a DM issue benchmark and found 2,422 new DM issues in 2,356 popular Golang projects. We reported 280 issues, among which 181 (64.6%) issues have been confirmed, and 160 of them (88.4%) have been fixed or are under fixing. Almost all the fixes have adopted our fixing suggestions.",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402016",
    "abstract": "With the growth of the open-source data science community, both the number of data science libraries and the number of versions for the same library are increasing rapidly. To match the evolving APIs from those libraries, open-source organizations often have to exert manual effort to refactor the APIs used in the code base. Moreover, due to the abundance of similar open-source libraries, data scientists working on a certain application may have an abundance of libraries to choose, maintain and migrate between. The manual refactoring between APIs is a tedious and error-prone task. Although recent research efforts were made on performing automatic API refactoring between different languages, previous work relies on statistical learning with collected pairwise training data for the API matching and migration. Using large statistical data for refactoring is not ideal because such training data will not be available for a new library or a new version of the same library. We introduce Synthesis for Open-Source API Refactoring (SOAR), a novel technique that requires no training data to achieve API migration and refactoring. SOAR relies only on the documentation that is readily available at the release of the library to learn API representations and mapping between libraries. Using program synthesis, SOAR automatically computes the correct configuration of arguments to the APIs and any glue code required to invoke those APIs. SOAR also uses the interpreter's error messages when running refactored code to generate logical constraints that can be used to prune the search space. Our empirical evaluation shows that SOAR can successfully refactor 80% of our benchmarks corresponding to deep learning models with up to 44 layers with an average run time of 97.23 seconds, and 90% of the data wrangling benchmarks with an average run time of 17.31 seconds.",

We present FeaRS, a novel retrieval-based approach that, given the current code a developer is writing in the IDE, can recommend the next complete method (i.e., signature and method body) that the developer is likely to implement. To do this, FeaRS exploits \"implementation patterns\" (i.e., groups of methods usually implemented within the same task) learned by mining thousands of open source projects.

    "abstract": "Code prediction, more specifically autocomplete, has become an essential feature in modern IDEs. Autocomplete is more effective when the desired next token is at (or close to) the top of the list of potential completions offered by the IDE at cursor position. This is where the strength of the underlying machine learning system that produces a ranked order of potential completions comes into play. We advance the state-of-the-art in the accuracy of code prediction (next token prediction) used in autocomplete systems. Our work uses Transformers as the base neural architecture. We show that by making the Transformer architecture aware of the syntactic structure of code, we increase the margin by which a Transformer-based system outperforms previous systems. With this, it outperforms the accuracy of several state-of-the-art next token prediction systems by margins ranging from 14% to 18%. We present in the paper several ways of communicating the code structure to the Transformer, which is fundamentally built for processing sequence data. We provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our proposal, along with alternative design choices, on a standard Python dataset, as well as on Facebook internal Python corpus.

    "abstract": "Code reviews are popular in both industrial and open source projects. The benefits of code reviews are widely recognized and include better code quality and lower likelihood of introducing bugs. However, since code review is a manual activity it comes at the cost of spending developers' time on reviewing their teammates' code. Our goal is to make the first step towards partially automating the code review process, thus, possibly reducing the manual costs associated with it. We focus on both the contributor and the reviewer sides of the process, by training two different Deep Learning architectures. The first one learns code changes performed by developers during real code review activities, thus providing the contributor with a revised version of her code implementing code transformations usually recommended during code review before the code is even submitted for review. The second one automatically provides the reviewer commenting on a submitted code with the revised code implementing her comments expressed in natural language. The empirical evaluation of the two models shows that, on the contributor side, the trained model succeeds in replicating the code transformations applied during code reviews in up to 16% of cases. On the reviewer side, the model can correctly implement a comment provided in natural language in up to 31% of cases.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, like traditional software systems, provide a large number of configuration options. A deep learning model can be configured with different hyperparameters and neural architectures. Recently, AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) has been widely adopted to automate model training by systematically exploring diverse configurations. However, current AutoML approaches do not take into consideration the computational constraints imposed by various resources such as available memory, computing power of devices, or execution time. The training with non-conforming configurations could lead to many failed AutoML trial jobs or inappropriate models, which cause significant resource waste and severely slow down development productivity. In this paper, we propose DnnSAT, a resource-guided AutoML approach for deep learning models to help existing AutoML tools efficiently reduce the configuration space ahead of time. DnnSAT can speed up the search process and achieve equal or even better model learning performance because it excludes trial jobs not satisfying the constraints and saves resources for more trials. We formulate the resource-guided configuration space reduction as a constraint satisfaction problem. DnnSAT includes a unified analytic cost model to construct common constraints with respect to the model weight size, number of floating-point operations, model inference time, and GPU memory consumption. It then utilizes an SMT solver to obtain the satisfiable configurations of hyperparameters and neural architectures. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of DnnSAT in accelerating state-of-the-art AutoML methods (Hyperparameter Optimization and Neural Architecture Search) with an average speedup from 1.19X to 3.95X on public benchmarks. We believe that DnnSAT can make AutoML more practical in a real-world environment with constrained resources.",

    "abstract": "Many techniques were proposed for detecting software misconfigurations in cloud systems and for diagnosing unintended behavior caused by such misconfigurations. Detection and diagnosis are steps in the right direction: misconfigurations cause many costly failures and severe performance issues.

Little is known about how and why developers evolve configuration design and implementation, and the challenges that they face in doing so. This paper presents a source-code level study of the evolution of configuration design and implementation in cloud systems. Our goal is to understand the rationale and developer practices for revising initial configuration design/implementation decisions, especially in response to consequences of misconfigurations. To this end, we studied 1178 configuration-related commits from a 2.5 year version-control history of four large-scale, actively-maintained open-source cloud systems (HDFS, HBase, Spark, and Cassandra). We derive new insights into the software configuration engineering process. Our results motivate new techniques for proactively reducing misconfigurations by improving the configuration design and implementation process in cloud systems.

    "abstract": "Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is an important technique for testing highly configurable software systems with demonstrated effectiveness in practice. The goal of CIT is to generate test cases covering the interactions of configuration options, under certain hard constraints. In this context, constrained covering arrays (CCAs) are frequently used as test cases in CIT. Constrained Covering Array Generation (CCAG) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, solving which requires an effective method for generating small CCAs. In particular, effectively solving t-way CCAG with t>=4 is even more challenging. Inspired by the success of automated algorithm configuration and automated algorithm selection in solving combinatorial optimization problems, in this paper, we investigate the efficacy of automated algorithm configuration and automated algorithm selection for the CCAG problem, and propose a novel, automated CCAG approach called AutoCCAG. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that AutoCCAG can find much smaller-sized CCAs than current state-of-the-art approaches, indicating the effectiveness of AutoCCAG. More encouragingly, to our best knowledge, our paper reports the first results for CCAG with a high coverage strength (i.e., 5-way CCAG) on public benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that AutoCCAG can bring considerable benefits in testing highly configurable software systems.",

    "abstract": "The reliability of software that has a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a component is urgently important today given the increasing number of critical applications being deployed with DNNs. The need for reliability raises a need for rigorous testing of the safety and trustworthiness of these systems. In the last few years, there have been a number of research efforts focused on testing DNNs. However the test generation techniques proposed so far lack a check to determine whether the test inputs they are generating are valid, and thus invalid inputs are produced. To illustrate this situation, we explored three recent DNN testing techniques. Using deep generative model based input validation, we show that all the three techniques generate significant number of invalid test inputs. We further analyzed the test coverage achieved by the test inputs generated by the DNN testing techniques and showed how invalid test inputs can falsely inflate test coverage metrics. To overcome the inclusion of invalid inputs in testing, we propose a technique to incorporate the valid input space of the DNN model under test in the test generation process. Our technique uses a deep generative model-based algorithm to generate only valid inputs. Results of our empirical studies show that our technique is effective in eliminating invalid tests and boosting the number of valid test inputs generated.",

Such systems are complex; they are comprised of ML models and many subsystems that support learning processes. As with other complex systems, ML systems are prone to classic technical debt issues, especially when such systems are long-lived, but they also exhibit debt specific to these systems. Unfortunately, there is a gap of knowledge in how ML systems actually evolve and are maintained. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying refactorings, i.e., source-to-source semantics-preserving program transformations, performed in real-world, open-source software, and the technical debt issues they alleviate. We analyzed 26 projects, consisting of 4.2 MLOC, along with 327 manually examined code patches. The results indicate that developers refactor these systems for a variety of reasons, both specific and tangential to ML, some refactorings correspond to established technical debt categories, while others do not, and code duplication is a major cross-cutting theme that particularly involved ML configuration and model code, which was also the most refactored. We also introduce 14 and 7 new ML-specific refactorings and technical debt categories, respectively, and put forth several recommendations, best practices, and anti-patterns.

To address these problems, we propose an approach and a tool that automatically determines whether the model is buggy or not, and identifies the root causes for DNN errors. Our key insight is that historic trends in values propagated between layers can be analyzed to identify faults, and also localize faults. To that end, we first enable dynamic analysis of deep learning applications: by converting it into an imperative representation and alternatively using a callback mechanism. Both mechanisms allows us to insert probes that enable dynamic analysis over the traces produced by the DNN while it is being trained on the training data. We then conduct dynamic analysis over the traces to identify the faulty layer or hyperparameter that causes the error. We propose an algorithm for identifying root causes by capturing any numerical error and monitoring the model during training and finding the relevance of every layer/parameter on the DNN outcome. We have collected a benchmark containing 40 buggy models and patches that contain real errors in deep learning applications from Stack Overflow and GitHub. Our benchmark can be used to evaluate automated debugging tools and repair techniques. We have evaluated our approach using this DNN bug-and-patch benchmark, and the results showed that our approach is much more effective than the existing debugging approach used in the state-of-the-practice Keras library. For 34/40 cases, our approach was able to detect faults whereas the best debugging approach provided by Keras detected 32/40 faults. Our approach was able to localize 21/40 bugs whereas Keras did not localize any faults.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical components. Unlike the program bytecode whose vulnerabilities and threats have been widely-discussed, whether and how the deep learning models deployed in the applications can be compromised are not well-understood since Neural Networks are usually viewed as a black box. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical backdoor attack achieved with a set of reverse-engineering techniques over compiled deep learning models. The core of the attack is a neural conditional branch constructed with a trigger detector and several operators and injected into the victim model as a malicious payload. The attack is effective as the conditional logic can be flexibly customized by the attacker, and scalable as it does not require any prior knowledge from the original model. We evaluated the attack effectiveness using 5 state-of-the-art deep learning models and real-world samples collected from 30 users. The results demonstrated that the injected backdoor can be triggered with a success rate of 93.5%, while only brought less than 2ms latency overhead and no more than 1.4% accuracy decrease. We further conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play. We found 54 apps that were vulnerable to our attack, including popular and security-critical ones. The results call for the awareness of deep learning application developers and auditors to enhance the protection of deployed models.",

This paper explores broadening the application of existing adversarial attack techniques for the falsification of DNN safety properties. We contend and later show that such attacks provide a powerful repertoire of scalable algorithms for property falsification. To enable the broad application of falsification, we introduce a semantics-preserving reduction of multiple safety property types, which subsume prior work, into a set of equivalid correctness problems amenable to adversarial attacks. We evaluate our reduction approach as an enabler of falsification on a range of DNN correctness problems and show its cost-effectiveness and scalability.",

However, existing testing techniques focus on the quality of DL models but lacks attention to the core underlying inference engines (i.e., frameworks and libraries). Inspired by the success stories of fuzz testing, we design a graph-based fuzz testing method to improve the quality of DL inference engines. This method is naturally followed by the graph structure of DL models. A novel operator-level coverage criterion based on graph theory is introduced and six different mutations are implemented to generate diversified DL models by exploring combinations of model structures, parameters, and data inputs. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used to drive DL model generation without a training process. The experimental results show that the MCTS outperforms the random method in boosting operator-level coverage and detecting exceptions. Our method has discovered more than 40 different exceptions in three types of undesired behaviors: model conversion failure, inference failure, output comparison failure. The mutation strategies are useful to generate new valid test inputs, by up to an 8.2% more operator-level coverage on average and 8.6 more exceptions captured.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a significant growth of interest in applying software engineering techniques for the quality assurance of deep learning (DL) systems. One popular direction is deep learning testing, where adversarial examples (a.k.a.~bugs) of DL systems are found either by fuzzing or guided search with the help of certain testing metrics. However, recent studies have revealed that the commonly used neuron coverage metrics by existing DL testing approaches are not correlated to model robustness. It is also not an effective measurement on the confidence of the model robustness after testing. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel testing framework called Robustness-Oriented Testing (RobOT). A key part of RobOT is a quantitative measurement on 1) the value of each test case in improving model robustness (often via retraining), and 2) the convergence quality of the model robustness improvement. RobOT utilizes the proposed metric to automatically generate test cases valuable for improving model robustness. The proposed metric is also a strong indicator on how well robustness improvement has converged through testing. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of RobOT in improving DL model robustness, with 67.02% increase on the adversarial robustness that is 50.65% higher than the state-of-the-art work DeepGini.",

    "abstract": "Despite the functional success of deep Neural Networks, their trustworthiness remains a crucial open challenge. To address this challenge, both testing and verification techniques have been proposed. But these existing techniques provide either scalability to large networks or formal guarantees, not both. In this paper, we propose a scalable quantitative verification framework for deep Neural Networks, i.e., a test-driven approach that comes with formal guarantees that a desired probabilistic property is satisfied. Our technique performs enough tests until soundness of a formal probabilistic property can be proven. It can be used to certify properties of both deterministic and randomized DNNs. We implement our approach in a tool called PROVERO and apply it in the context of certifying adversarial robustness of DNNs. In this context, we first show a new attack-agnostic measure of robustness which offers an alternative to purely attack-based methodology of evaluating robustness being reported today. Second, PROVERO provides certificates of robustness for large DNNs, where existing state-of-the-art verification tools fail to produce conclusive results. Our work paves the way forward for verifying properties of distributions captured by real-world deep Neural Networks, with provable guarantees, even where testers only have black-box access to the neural network.",

    "abstract": "Software traceability establishes and leverages associations between diverse development artifacts. Researchers have proposed the use of deep learning trace models to link natural language artifacts, such as requirements and issue descriptions, to source code; however, their effectiveness has been restricted by availability of labeled data and efficiency at runtime. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Trace BERT (T-BERT) to generate trace links between source code and natural language artifacts. To address data sparsity, we leverage a three-step training strategy to enable trace models to transfer knowledge from a closely related Software Engineering challenge, which has a rich dataset, to produce trace links with much higher accuracy than has previously been achieved. We then apply the T-BERT framework to recover links between issues and commits in Open Source Projects. We comparatively evaluated accuracy and efficiency of three BERT architectures. Results show that a Single-BERT architecture generated the most accurate links, while a Siamese-BERT architecture produced comparable results with significantly less execution time. Furthermore, by learning and transferring knowledge, all three models in the framework outperform classical IR trace models. On the three evaluated real-word OSS projects, the best T-BERT stably outperformed the VSM model with average improvements of 60.31% measured using Mean Average Precision (MAP). RNN severely underperformed on these projects due to insufficient training data, while T-BERT overcame this problem by using pretrained language models and transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) techniques are gaining more and more attention in the software engineering community. They have been used to support several code-related tasks, such as automatic bug fixing and code comments generation. Recent studies in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field have shown that the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture can achieve state-of-the-art performance for a variety of NLP tasks. The basic idea behind T5 is to first pre-train a model on a large and generic dataset using a self-supervised task (e.g., filling masked words in sentences). Once the model is pre-trained, it is fine-tuned on smaller and specialized datasets, each one related to a specific task (e.g., language translation, sentence classification). In this paper, we empirically investigate how the T5 model performs when pre-trained and fine-tuned to support code-related tasks. We pre-train a T5 model on a dataset composed of natural language English text and source code. Then, we fine-tune such a model by reusing datasets used in four previous works that used DL techniques to: (i) fix bugs, (ii) inject code mutants, (iii) generate assert statements, and (iv) generate code comments. We compared the performance of this single model with the results reported in the four original papers proposing DL-based solutions for those four tasks. We show that our T5 model, exploiting additional data for the self-supervised pre-training phase, can achieve performance improvements over the four baselines.",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402144",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are typically tested for accuracy relying on a set of unlabelled real world data (operational dataset), from which a subset is selected, manually labelled and used as test suite. This subset is required to be small (due to manual labelling cost) yet to faithfully represent the operational context, with the resulting test suite containing roughly the same proportion of examples causing misprediction (i.e., failing test cases) as the operational dataset. However, while testing to estimate accuracy, it is desirable to also learn as much as possible from the failing tests in the operational dataset, since they inform about possible bugs of the DNN. A smart sampling strategy may allow to intentionally include in the test suite many examples causing misprediction, thus providing this way more valuable inputs for DNN improvement while preserving the ability to get trustworthy unbiased estimates. This paper presents a test selection technique (DeepEST) that actively looks for failing test cases in the operational dataset of a DNN, with the goal of assessing the DNN expected accuracy by a small and \"informative\" test suite (namely with a high number of mispredictions) for subsequent DNN improvement. Experiments with five subjects, combining four DNN models and three datasets, are described. The results show that DeepEST provides DNN accuracy estimates with precision close to (and often better than) those of existing sampling-based DNN testing techniques, while detecting from 5 to 30 times more mispredictions, with the same test suite size.",

Existing DNN debugging tools are either post-training which wastes a lot of time training a buggy model and requires expertises, or limited on collecting training logs without analyzing the problem not even fixing them. In this paper, we propose AUTOTRAINER, a DNN training monitoring and automatic repairing tool which supports detecting and auto repairing five commonly seen training problems. During training, it periodically checks the training status and detects potential problems. Once a problem is found, AUTOTRAINER tries to fix it by using built-in state-of-the-art solutions. It supports various model structures and input data types, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for texts. Our evaluation on 6 datasets, 495 models show that AUTOTRAINER can effectively detect all potential problems with 100% detection rate and no false positives. Among all models with problems, it can fix 97.33% of them, increasing the accuracy by 47.08% on average.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in important domains raises questions about the trustworthiness of DNN outputs. Even a highly accurate DNN will make mistakes some of the time, and in settings like self-driving vehicles these mistakes must be quickly detected and properly dealt with in deployment. Just as our community has developed effective techniques and mechanisms to monitor and check programmed components, we believe it is now necessary to do the same for DNNs. In this paper we present DNN self-checking as a process by which internal DNN layer features are used to check DNN predictions. We detail SelfChecker, a self-checking system that monitors DNN outputs and triggers an alarm if the internal layer features of the model are inconsistent with the final prediction. SelfChecker also provides advice in the form of an alternative prediction. We evaluated SelfChecker on four popular image datasets and three DNN models and found that SelfChecker triggers correct alarms on 60.56% of wrong DNN predictions, and false alarms on 2.04% of correct DNN predictions. This is a substantial improvement over prior work (SelfOracle, Dissector, and ConfidNet). In experiments with self-driving car scenarios, SelfChecker triggers more correct alarms than SelfOracle for two DNN models (DAVE-2 and Chauffeur) with comparable false alarms.

Testers are expected to compare multiple DL models and select the more suitable ones w.r.t. the whole testing context. Due to the limitation of labeling effort, testers aim to select an efficient subset of samples to make an as precise rank estimation as possible for these models. To tackle this problem, we propose Sample Discrimination based Selection (SDS) to select efficient samples that could discriminate multiple models, i.e., the prediction behaviors (right/wrong) of these samples would be helpful to indicate the trend of model performance. To evaluate SDS, we conduct an extensive empirical study with three widely-used image datasets and 80 real world DL models. The experiment results show that, compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, SDS is an effective and efficient sample selection method to rank multiple DL models.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) testing is one of the most widely-used ways to guarantee the quality of DNNs. However, labeling test inputs to check the correctness of DNN prediction is very costly, which could largely affect the efficiency of DNN testing, even the whole process of DNN development. To relieve the labeling-cost problem, we propose a novel test input prioritization approach (called PRIMA) for DNNs via intelligent mutation analysis in order to label more bug-revealing test inputs earlier for a limited time, which facilitates to improve the efficiency of DNN testing. PRIMA is based on the key insight: a test input that is able to kill many mutated models and produce different prediction results with many mutated inputs, is more likely to reveal DNN bugs, and thus it should be prioritized higher. After obtaining a number of mutation results from a series of our designed model and input mutation rules for each test input, PRIMA further incorporates learning-to-rank (a kind of supervised machine learning to solve ranking problems) to intelligently combine these mutation results for effective test input prioritization. We conducted an extensive study based on 36 popular subjects by carefully considering their diversity from five dimensions (i.e., different domains of test inputs, different DNN tasks, different network structures, different types of test inputs, and different training scenarios). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMA, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches (with the average improvement of 8.50%~131.01% in terms of prioritization effectiveness). In particular, we have applied PRIMA to the practical autonomous-vehicle testing in a large motor company, and the results on 4 real-world scene-recognition models in autonomous vehicles further confirm the practicability of PRIMA.",

People routinely use machine translation software in their daily lives for tasks such as ordering food in a foreign restaurant, receiving medical diagnosis and treatment from foreign doctors, and reading international political news online. However, due to the complexity and intractability of the underlying Neural Networks, modern machine translation software is still far from robust and can produce poor or incorrect translations; this can lead to misunderstanding, financial loss, threats to personal safety and health, and political conflicts. To address this problem, we introduce referentially transparent inputs (RTIs), a simple, widely applicable methodology for validating machine translation software. A referentially transparent input is a piece of text that should have similar translations when used in different contexts. Our practical implementation, Purity, detects when this property is broken by a translation. To evaluate RTI, we use Purity to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 unlabeled sentences, which detected 123 and 142 erroneous translations with high precision (79.3% and 78.3%). The translation errors are diverse, including examples of under-translation, over-translation, word/phrase mistranslation, incorrect modification, and unclear logic.",

In this paper, we propose WebExplor, an automatic end-to-end web testing framework, to achieve an adaptive exploration of web applications. WebExplor adopts a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to generate high-quality action sequences (test cases) with temporal logical relations. Besides, WebExplor incrementally builds an automaton during the online testing process, which acts as the high-level guidance to further improve the testing efficiency. We have conducted comprehensive evaluations on six real-world projects, a commercial SaaS web application, and performed an in-the-wild study of the top 50 web applications in the world.

    "abstract": "The SZZ algorithm for identifying bug-inducing changes has been widely used to evaluate defect prediction techniques and to empirically investigate when, how, and by whom bugs are introduced. Over the years, researchers have proposed several heuristics to improve the SZZ accuracy, providing various implementations of SZZ. However, fairly evaluating those implementations on a reliable oracle is an open problem: SZZ evaluations usually rely on (i) the manual analysis of the SZZ output to classify the identified bug-inducing commits as true or false positives; or (ii) a golden set linking bug-fixing and bug-inducing commits. In both cases, these manual evaluations are performed by researchers with limited knowledge of the studied subject systems. Ideally, there should be a golden set created by the original developers of the studied systems. We propose a methodology to build a \"developer-informed\" oracle for the evaluation of SZZ variants. We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify bug-fixing commits in which developers explicitly reference the commit(s) that introduced a fixed bug. This was followed by a manual filtering step aimed at ensuring the quality and accuracy of the oracle. Once built, we used the oracle to evaluate several variants of the SZZ algorithm in terms of their accuracy.

Across these projects, most of the defects occur very early in their life cycle. Hence, defect predictors learned from the first 150 commits and four months perform just as well as anything else. This means that, at least for the projects studied here, after the first few months, we need not continually update our defect prediction models.

Our results show that the existence of a visible attack scenario facilitates the detection of IIV vulnerabilities and that a significant portion of developers who did not find the vulnerability initially could identify it when warned about its existence. Yet, a total of 60 participants could not detect the vulnerability even after the warning. Other factors, such as the frequency with which the participants perform code reviews, influence the detection of IIV. Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06251.

    "abstract": "Static code analysis tools and integrated development environments present developers with quality-related software metrics, some of which describe the understandability of source code. Software metrics influence overarching strategic decisions that impact the future of companies and the prioritization of everyday software development tasks. Several software metrics, however, lack in validation: we just choose to trust that they reflect what they are supposed to measure. Some of them were even shown to not measure the quality aspects they intend to measure. Yet, they influence us through biases in our cognitive-driven actions. In particular, they might anchor us in our decisions. Whether the anchoring effect exists with software metrics has not been studied yet. We conducted a randomized and double-blind experiment to investigate the extent to which a displayed metric value for source code comprehensibility anchors developers in their subjective rating of source code comprehensibility, whether performance is affected by the anchoring effect when working on comprehension tasks, and which individual characteristics might play a role in the anchoring effect. We found that the displayed value of a comprehensibility metric has a significant and large anchoring effect on a developer's code comprehensibility rating. The effect does not seem to affect the time or correctness when working on comprehension questions related to the code snippets under study. Since the anchoring effect is one of the most robust cognitive biases, and we have limited understanding of the consequences of the demonstrated manipulation of developers by non-validated metrics, we call for an increased awareness of the responsibility in code quality reporting and for corresponding tools to be based on scientific evidence.",

    "abstract": "Background: Researchers and practitioners have been using code complexity metrics for decades to predict how developers comprehend a program. While it is plausible and tempting to use code metrics for this purpose, their validity is debated, since they rely on simple code properties and rarely consider particularities of human cognition. Aims: We investigate whether and how code complexity metrics reflect difficulty of program comprehension. Method: We have conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with 19 participants observing program comprehension of short code snippets at varying complexity levels. We dissected four classes of code complexity metrics and their relationship to neuronal, behavioral, and subjective correlates of program comprehension, overall analyzing more than 41 metrics. Results: While our data corroborate that complexity metrics can-to a limited degree-explain programmers' cognition in program comprehension, fMRI allowed us to gain insights into why some code properties are difficult to process. In particular, a code's textual size drives programmers' attention, and vocabulary size burdens programmers' working memory. Conclusion: Our results provide neuro-scientific evidence supporting warnings of prior research questioning the validity of code complexity metrics and pin down factors relevant to program comprehension. Future Work: We outline several follow-up experiments investigating fine-grained effects of code complexity and describe possible refinements to code complexity metrics.",

In this paper, we develop screener questions that are easy and quick to answer for people with programming skill but difficult to answer correctly for those without. In order to evaluate our questionnaire for efficacy and efficiency, we recruited several batches of participants with and without programming skill and tested the questions. In our batch 42% of Clickworkers stating that they have programming skill did not meet our criteria and we would recommend filtering these from studies.

    "abstract": "We examine how the behavior of software developers changes in response to removing gamification elements from GitHub, an online platform for collaborative programming and software development. We find that the unannounced removal of daily activity streak counters from the user interface (from user profile pages) was followed by significant changes in behavior. Long-running streaks of activity were abandoned and became less common. Weekend activity decreased and days in which developers made a single contribution became less common. Synchronization of streaking behavior in the platform's social network also decreased, suggesting that gamification is a powerful channel for social influence. Focusing on a set of software developers that were publicly pursuing a goal to make contributions for 100 days in a row, we find that some of these developers abandon this quest following the removal of the public streak counter. Our findings provide evidence for the significant impact of gamification on the behavior of developers on large collaborative programming and software development platforms. They urge caution: gamification can steer the behavior of software developers in unexpected and unwanted directions.",

    "abstract": "Identifier names convey useful information about the intended semantics of code. Name-based program analyses use this information, e.g., to detect bugs, to predict types, and to improve the readability of code. At the core of name-based analyses are semantic representations of identifiers, e.g., in the form of learned embeddings. The high-level goal of such a representation is to encode whether two identifiers, e.g., len and size, are semantically similar. Unfortunately, it is currently unclear to what extent semantic representations match the semantic relatedness and similarity perceived by developers. This paper presents IdBench, the first benchmark for evaluating semantic representations against a ground truth created from thousands of ratings by 500 software developers. We use IdBench to study state-of-the-art embedding techniques proposed for natural language, an embedding technique specifically designed for source code, and lexical string distance functions. Our results show that the effectiveness of semantic representations varies significantly and that the best available embeddings successfully represent semantic relatedness. On the downside, no existing technique provides a satisfactory representation of semantic similarities, among other reasons because identifiers with opposing meanings are incorrectly considered to be similar, which may lead to fatal mistakes, e.g., in a refactoring tool. Studying the strengths and weaknesses of the different techniques shows that they complement each other. As a first step toward exploiting this complementarity, we present an ensemble model that combines existing techniques and that clearly outperforms the best available semantic representation.",

    "abstract": "Misleading method names in software projects can confuse developers, which may lead to software defects and affect code understandability. In this paper, we present DeepName, a context-based, deep learning approach to detect method name inconsistencies and suggest a proper name for a method. The key departure point is the philosophy of \"Show Me Your Friends, I'll Tell You Who You Are\". Unlike the state-of-the-art approaches, in addition to the method's body, we also consider the interactions of the current method under study with the other ones including the caller and callee methods, and the sibling methods in the same enclosing class. The sequences of sub-tokens in the program entities' names in the contexts are extracted and used as the input for an RNN-based encoder-decoder to produce the representations for the current method. We modify that RNN model to integrate the copy mechanism and our newly developed component, called the non-copy mechanism, to emphasize on the possibility of a certain sub-token not to be copied to follow the current sub-token in the currently generated method name. We conducted several experiments to evaluate DeepName on large datasets with +14M methods. For consistency checking, DeepName improves the state-of-the-art approach by 2.1%, 19.6%, and 11.9% relatively in recall, precision, and F-score, respectively. For name suggestion, DeepName improves relatively over the state-of-the-art approaches in precision (1.8%–30.5%), recall (8.8%–46.1%), and F-score (5.2%–38.2%). To assess DeepName's usefulness, we detected inconsistent methods and suggested new method names in active projects. Among 50 pull requests, 12 were merged into the main branch. In total, in 30/50 cases, the team members agree that our suggested method names are more meaningful than the current names.",

The survey results show that participants very much agree about the importance of various standards and how they apply to names and that years of experience and the programming language has almost no effect on their responses.

In recent years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns of neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have focused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31 participants, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the neural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled, contrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of reading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization task). Our primary result is that all three tasks-coding, prose reading, and mental rotation-are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally find more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a neural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later. While preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also provide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice programming.",

Their onboarding experience is correlated with productivity, job satisfaction, and other short-term and long-term outcomes. The majority of the onboarding process comprises engineering tasks such as fixing bugs or implementing small features. Nevertheless, we do not have a systematic view of how tasks influence onboarding. In this paper, we present a case study of Microsoft, where we interviewed 32 developers moving into a new team and 15 engineering managers onboarding a new developer into their team - to understand and characterize developers' onboarding experience and expectations in relation to the tasks performed by them while onboarding. We present how tasks interact with new developers through three representative themes: learning, confidence building, and socialization. We also discuss three onboarding strategies as inferred from the interviews that managers commonly use unknowingly, and discuss their pros and cons and offer situational recommendations. Furthermore, we triangulate our interview findings with a developer survey (N = 189) and a manager survey (N = 37) and find that survey results suggest that our findings are representative and our recommendations are actionable. Practitioners could use our findings to improve their onboarding processes, while researchers could find new research directions from this study to advance the understanding of developer onboarding.

    "abstract": "The mass shift to working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed the way many software development teams collaborate and communicate. To investigate how team culture and team productivity may also have been affected, we conducted two surveys at a large software company. The first, an exploratory survey during the early months of the pandemic with 2,265 developer responses, revealed that many developers faced challenges reaching milestones and that their team productivity had changed. We also found through qualitative analysis that important team culture factors such as communication and social connection had been affected. For example, the simple phrase \"How was your weekend?\" had become a subtle way to show peer support. In our second survey, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the team cultural factors that emerged from our first survey to understand the prevalence of the reported changes. From 608 developer responses, we found that 74% of these respondents missed social interactions with colleagues and 51% reported a decrease in their communication ease with colleagues. We used data from the second survey to build a regression model to identify important team culture factors for modeling team productivity. We found that the ability to brainstorm with colleagues, difficulty communicating with colleagues, and satisfaction with interactions from social activities are important factors that are associated with how developers report their software development team's productivity. Our findings inform how managers and leaders in large software companies can support sustained team productivity during times of crisis and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Fault localization is a practical research topic that helps developers identify code locations that might cause bugs in a program. Most existing fault localization techniques are designed for imperative programs (e.g., C and Java) and rely on analyzing correct and incorrect executions of the program to identify suspicious statements. In this work, we introduce a fault localization approach for models written in a declarative language, where the models are not \"executed,\" but rather converted into a logical formula and solved using backend constraint solvers. We present FLACK, a tool that takes as input an Alloy model consisting of some violated assertion and returns a ranked list of suspicious expressions contributing to the assertion violation. The key idea is to analyze the differences between counterexamples, i.e., instances of the model that do not satisfy the assertion, and instances that do satisfy the assertion to find suspicious expressions in the input model. The experimental results show that FLACK is efficient (can handle complex, real-world Alloy models with thousand lines of code within 5 seconds), accurate (can consistently rank buggy expressions in the top 1.9% of the suspicious list), and useful (can often narrow down the error to the exact location within the suspicious expressions).",

SFL techniques typically employ one type of profile data: either coverage data, predicate outcomes, or variable values. Most SFL techniques actually measure correlation, not causation, between profile values and success/failure, and so they are subject to confounding bias that distorts the scores they produce. This paper presents a new SFL technique, named UniVal, that uses causal inference techniques and machine learning to integrate information about both predicate outcomes and variable values to more accurately estimate the true failure-causing effect of program statements. UniVal was empirically compared to several coverage-based, predicate-based, and value-based SFL techniques on 800 program versions with real faults.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose DeepRL4FL, a deep learning fault localization (FL) approach that locates the buggy code at the statement and method levels by treating FL as an image pattern recognition problem. DeepRL4FL does so via novel code coverage representation learning (RL) and data dependencies RL for program statements. Those two types of RL on the dynamic information in a code coverage matrix are also combined with the code representation learning on the static information of the usual suspicious source code. This combination is inspired by crime scene investigation in which investigators analyze the crime scene (failed test cases and statements) and related persons (statements with dependencies), and at the same time, examine the usual suspects who have committed a similar crime in the past (similar buggy code in the training data). For the code coverage information, DeepRL4FL first orders the test cases and marks error-exhibiting code statements, expecting that a model can recognize the patterns discriminating between faulty and non-faulty statements/methods. For dependencies among statements, the suspiciousness of a statement is seen taking into account the data dependencies to other statements in execution and data flows, in addition to the statement by itself. Finally, the vector representations for code coverage matrix, data dependencies among statements, and source code are combined and used as the input of a classifier built from a Convolution Neural Network to detect buggy statements/methods. Our empirical evaluation shows that DeepRL4FL improves the top-1 results over the state-of-the-art statement-level FL baselines from 173.1% to 491.7%. It also improves the top-1 results over the existing method-level FL baselines from 15.0% to 206.3%.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is moving its step into a growing number of mobile software applications. These software applications, named as DL based mobile applications (abbreviated as mobile DL apps) integrate DL models trained using large-scale data with DL programs. A DL program encodes the structure of a desirable DL model and the process by which the model is trained using training data. Due to the increasing dependency of current mobile apps on DL, software engineering (SE) for mobile DL apps has become important. However, existing efforts in SE research community mainly focus on the development of DL models and extensively analyze faults in DL programs. In contrast, faults related to the deployment of DL models on mobile devices (named as deployment faults of mobile DL apps) have not been well studied. Since mobile DL apps have been used by billions of end users daily for various purposes including for safety-critical scenarios, characterizing their deployment faults is of enormous importance. To fill in the knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study to date on the deployment faults of mobile DL apps. We identify 304 real deployment faults from Stack Overflow and GitHub, two commonly used data sources for studying software faults. Based on the identified faults, we construct a fine-granularity taxonomy consisting of 23 categories regarding to fault symptoms and distill common fix strategies for different fault symptoms. Furthermore, we suggest actionable implications and research avenues that can potentially facilitate the deployment of DL models on mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "High-quality and large-scale repositories of real bugs and their concise patches collected from real-world applications are critical for research in software engineering community. In such a repository, each real bug is explicitly associated with its fix. Therefore, on one side, the real bugs and their fixes may inspire novel approaches for finding, locating, and repairing software bugs; on the other side, the real bugs and their fixes are indispensable for rigorous and meaningful evaluation of approaches for software testing, fault localization, and program repair. To this end, a number of such repositories, e.g., Defects4J, have been proposed. However, such repositories are rather small because their construction involves expensive human intervention. Although bug-fixing code commits as well as associated test cases could be retrieved from version control systems automatically, existing approaches could not yet automatically extract concise bug-fixing patches from bug-fixing commits because such commits often involve bug-irrelevant changes. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach, called BugBuilder, to extracting complete and concise bug-fixing patches from human-written patches in version control systems. It excludes refactorings by detecting refactorings involved in bug-fixing commits, and reapplying detected refactorings on the faulty version. It enumerates all subsets of the remaining part and validates them on test cases. If none of the subsets has the potential to be a complete bug-fixing patch, the remaining part as a whole is taken as a complete and concise bug-fixing patch. Evaluation results on 809 real bug-fixing commits in Defects4J suggest that BugBuilder successfully generated complete and concise bug-fixing patches for forty percent of the bug-fixing commits, and its precision (99%) was even higher than human experts.",

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach to allow for arbitrary Boolean combinations of patterns, giving testers unprecedented flexibility in creating targeted software tests. The resulting specialized grammars can be used with any grammar-based fuzzer for targeted test generation, but also as validators to check whether the given specialization is met or not, opening up additional usage scenarios.

It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to games in order to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied by notes that describe the changes to the game included in the update. However, some bugs reappear even after an update attempts to fix them. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy for bug types in games that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122 bug fixes from 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label the bug fixes included in these updates to identify the frequency of these different bug types, the rate at which bug types recur over multiple updates, and which bug types are treated as more severe. Additionally, we survey game developers regarding their experience with different bug types and what aspects of game development they most strongly associate with bug appearance. We find that Information bugs appear the most frequently in updates, while Crash bugs recur the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than other bug types. Finally, we find that challenges in testing, code quality, and bug reproduction have a close association with bug persistence. These findings should help developers identify which aspects of game development could benefit from greater attention in order to prevent bugs.

A good GUI design is crucial to the success of the software in the market, but designing a good GUI which requires much innovation and creativity is difficult even to well-trained designers. In addition, the requirement of rapid development of GUI design also aggravates designers' working load. So, the availability of various automated generated GUIs can help enhance the design personalization and specialization as they can cater to the taste of different designers. To assist designers, we develop a model tool to automatically generate GUI designs. Different from conventional image generation models based on image pixels, our tool is to reuse GUI components collected from existing mobile app GUIs for composing a new design which is similar to natural-language generation. Our tool is based on SeqGAN by modelling the GUI component style compatibility and GUI structure. The evaluation demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms the best of the baseline methods by 30.77% in Fr'echet Inception distance (FID) and 12.35% in 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA).

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402139",
    "abstract": "Just like code smells in source code, UI design has visual design smells. We study 93 don't-do-that guidelines in the Material Design, a complex design system created by Google. We find that these don't-guidelines go far beyond UI aesthetics, and involve seven general design dimensions (layout, typography, iconography, navigation, communication, color, and shape) and four component design aspects (anatomy, placement, behavior, and usage). Violating these guidelines results in visual design smells in UIs (or UI design smells). In a study of 60,756 UIs of 9,286 Android apps, we find that 7,497 UIs of 2,587 apps have at least one violation of some Material Design guidelines. This reveals the lack of developer training and tool support to avoid UI design smells. To fill this gap, we design an automated UI design smell detector (UIS-Hunter) that extracts and validates multi-modal UI information (component metadata, typography, iconography, color, and edge) for detecting the violation of diverse don't-guidelines in Material Design. The detection accuracy of UIS-Hunter is high (precision=0.81, recall=0.90) on the 60,756 UIs of 9,286 apps. We build a guideline gallery with real-world UI design smells that UIS-Hunter detects for developers to learn the best Material Design practices. Our user studies show that UIS-Hunter is more effective than manual detection of UI design smells, and the UI design smells that are detected by UIS-Hunter have severely negative impacts on app users.",

With clone-and-own and forking becoming prevalent, maintaining these shared files is important, especially for keeping the most up-to-date version of reused code. Different to related work, we propose the concept of meta-maintenance-i.e., tracking how the same files evolve in different repositories with the aim to provide useful maintenance opportunities to those files. We conduct an exploratory study by analyzing repositories from seven different programming languages to explore the potential of meta-maintenance. Our results indicate that a majority of active repositories on GitHub contains at least one file which is also present in another repository, and that a significant minority of these files are maintained differently in the different repositories which contain them. We manually analyzed a representative sample of shared files and their variants to understand which changes might be useful for meta-maintenance. Our findings support the potential of meta-maintenance and open up avenues for future work to capitalize on this potential.",

    "abstract": "Forking structure is widespread in the open-source repositories and that causes a significant number of merge conflicts. In this paper, we study the problem of textual merge conflicts from the perspective of Microsoft Edge, a large, highly collaborative fork off the main Chromium branch with significant merge conflicts. Broadly, this study is divided into two sections. First, we empirically evaluate textual merge conflicts in Microsoft Edge and classify them based on the type of files, location of conflicts in a file, and the size of conflicts. We found that ~28% of the merge conflicts are 1-2 line changes, and many resolutions have frequent patterns. Second, driven by these findings, we explore Program Synthesis (for the first time) to learn patterns and resolve structural merge conflicts. We propose a novel domain-specific language (DSL) that captures many of the repetitive merge conflict resolution patterns and learn resolution strategies as programs in this DSL from example resolutions. We found that the learned strategies can resolve 11.4% of the conflicts (~41% of 1-2 line changes) that arise in the C++ files with 93.2% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information from non-functional characteristics. Prior side-channel detection work is able to identify numerous potential vulnerabilities. However, in practice, many such vulnerabilities leak a negligible amount of sensitive information, and thus developers are often reluctant to address them. Existing tools do not provide information to evaluate a leak's severity, such as the number of leaked bits. To address this issue, we propose a new program analysis method to precisely quantify the leaked information in a single-trace attack through side-channels. It can identify covert information flows in programs that expose confidential information and can reason about security flaws that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, for a developer to find. We model an attacker's observation of each leakage site as a constraint. We use symbolic execution to generate these constraints and then run Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the number of leaked bits for each leakage site. By applying the Central Limit Theorem, we provide an error bound for these estimations. We have implemented the technique in a tool called Abacus, which not only finds very fine-grained side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimates how many bits are leaked. Abacus outperforms existing dynamic side-channel detection tools in performance and accuracy. We evaluate Abacus on OpenSSL, mbedTLS, Libgcrypt, and Monocypher. Our results demonstrate that most reported vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in practice and should be de-prioritized by developers. We also find several sensitive vulnerabilities that are missed by the existing tools. We confirm those vulnerabilities with manual checks and by contacting the developers.",

Compared to the conventional way of manually crafting such static analyzers, which can be tedious, error prone and suboptimal, our learning-based technique is not only automated but also provably sound. Our analyzer consists of a set of type-inference rules learned from the training data, i.e., example code snippets annotated with the ground truth. Internally, we use syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) to generate new recursive features and decision tree learning (DTL) to generate analysis rules based on these features. We guarantee soundness by proving each learned analysis rule via a technique called query containment checking. We have implemented our technique in the LLVM compiler and used it to detect power side channels in C programs that implement cryptographic protocols. Our results show that, in addition to being automated and provably sound during synthesis, our analyzer can achieve the same empirical accuracy as two state-of-the-art, manually-crafted analyzers while being 300X and 900X faster, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Images are essential for many Android applications or apps. Although images play a critical role in app functionalities and user experience, inefficient or improper image loading and displaying operations may severely impact the app performance and quality. Additionally, since these image loading defects may not be manifested by immediate failures, e.g., app crashes, existing GUI testing approaches cannot detect them effectively. In this paper, we identify five anti-patterns of such image loading defects, including image passing by intent, image decoding without resizing, local image loading without permission, repeated decoding without caching, and image decoding in UI thread. Based on these anti-patterns, we propose a static analysis technique, IMGDroid, to automatically and effectively detect such defects. We have applied IMGDroid to a benchmark of 21 open-source Android apps, and found that it not only successfully detects the 45 previously-known image loading defects but also finds 15 new such defects. Our empirical study on 1,000 commercial Android apps demonstrates that the image loading defects are prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Parametric model checking (PMC) computes algebraic formulae that express key non-functional properties of a system (reliability, performance, etc.) as rational functions of the system and environment parameters. In software engineering, PMC formulae can be used during design, e.g., to analyse the sensitivity of different system architectures to parametric variability, or to find optimal system configurations. They can also be used at runtime, e.g., to check if non-functional requirements are still satisfied after environmental changes, or to select new configurations after such changes. However, current PMC techniques do not scale well to systems with complex behaviour and more than a few parameters. Our paper introduces a fast PMC (fPMC) approach that overcomes this limitation, extending the applicability of PMC to a broader class of systems than previously possible. To this end, fPMC partitions the Markov models that PMC operates with into fragments whose reachability properties are analysed independently, and obtains PMC reachability formulae by combining the results of these fragment analyses. To demonstrate the effectiveness of fPMC, we show how our fPMC tool can analyse three systems (taken from the research literature, and belonging to different application domains) with which current PMC techniques and tools struggle.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems combine software and physical components. Specification-driven trace-checking tools for CPS usually provide users with a specification language to express the requirements of interest, and an automatic procedure to check whether these requirements hold on the execution traces of a CPS. Although there exist several specification languages for CPS, they are often not sufficiently expressive to allow the specification of complex CPS properties related to the software and the physical components and their interactions. In this paper, we propose (i) the Hybrid Logic of Signals (HLS), a logic-based language that allows the specification of complex CPS requirements, and (ii) ThEodorE, an efficient SMT-based trace-checking procedure. This procedure reduces the problem of checking a CPS requirement over an execution trace, to checking the satisfiability of an SMT formula. We evaluated our contributions by using a representative industrial case study in the satellite domain. We assessed the expressiveness of HLS by considering 212 requirements of our case study. HLS could express all the 212 requirements. We also assessed the applicability of ThEodorE by running the trace-checking procedure for 747 trace-requirement combinations. ThEodorE was able to produce a verdict in 74.5% of the cases. Finally, we compared HLS and ThEodorE with other specification languages and trace-checking tools from the literature. Our results show that, from a practical standpoint, our approach offers a better trade-off between expressiveness and performance.",

    "abstract": "Open-source software (OSS) is widely reused as it provides convenience and efficiency in software development. Despite evident benefits, unmanaged OSS components can introduce threats, such as vulnerability propagation and license violation. Unfortunately, however, identifying reused OSS components is a challenge as the reused OSS is predominantly modified and nested. In this paper, we propose CENTRIS, a precise and scalable approach for identifying modified OSS reuse. By segmenting an OSS code base and detecting the reuse of a unique part of the OSS only, CENTRIS is capable of precisely identifying modified OSS reuse in the presence of nested OSS components. For scalability, CENTRIS eliminates redundant code comparisons and accelerates the search using hash functions. When we applied CENTRIS on 10,241 widely-employed GitHub projects, comprising 229,326 versions and 80 billion lines of code, we observed that modified OSS reuse is a norm in software development, occurring 20 times more frequently than exact reuse. Nonetheless, CENTRIS identified reused OSS components with 91% precision and 94% recall in less than a minute per application on average, whereas a recent clone detection technique, which does not take into account modified and nested OSS reuse, hardly reached 10% precision and 40% recall.",

    "abstract": "Software reuse, especially partial reuse, poses legal and security threats to software development. Since its source codes are usually unavailable, software reuse is hard to be detected with interpretation. On the other hand, current approaches suffer from poor detection accuracy and efficiency, far from satisfying practical demands. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose ISRD, an interpretation-enabled software reuse detection approach based on a multi-level birthmark model that contains function level, basic block level, and instruction level. To overcome obfuscation caused by cross-compilation, we represent function semantics with Minimum Branch Path (MBP) and perform normalization to extract core semantics of instructions. For efficiently detecting reused functions, a process for \"intent search based on anchor recognition\" is designed to speed up reuse detection. It uses strict instruction match and identical library call invocation check to find anchor functions (in short anchors) and then traverses neighbors of the anchors to explore potentially matched function pairs. Extensive experiments based on two real-world binary datasets reveal that ISRD is interpretable, effective, and efficient, which achieves 97.2% precision and 94.8% recall. Moreover, it is resilient to cross-compilation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-based services are surging into popularity in recent years. However, outages, i.e., severe incidents that always impact multiple services, can dramatically affect user experience and incur severe economic losses. Locating the root-cause service, i.e., the service that contains the root cause of the outage, is a crucial step to mitigate the impact of the outage. In current industrial practice, this is generally performed in a bootstrap manner and largely depends on human efforts: the service that directly causes the outage is identified first, and the suspected root cause is traced back manually from service to service during diagnosis until the actual root cause is found. Unfortunately, production cloud systems typically contain a large number of interdependent services. Such a manual root cause analysis is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose COT, the first outage triage approach that considers the global view of service correlations. COT mines the correlations among services from outage diagnosis data. After learning from historical outages, COT can infer the root cause of emerging ones accurately. We implement COT and evaluate it on a real-world dataset containing one year of data collected from Microsoft Azure, one of the representative cloud computing platforms in the world. Our experimental results show that COT can reach a triage accuracy of 82.1%-83.5%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art triage approach by 28.0%-29.7%.",

Our approach uses machine learning applied on a combined scheme of graph and vector-based representations of static code features. Our results, from 50 commits in 21 Coreutils programs, demonstrate a strong prediction ability of our approach; yielding 0.80 (ROC) and 0.50 (PR Curve) AUC values with 0.63 and 0.32 precision and recall values. These predictions are significantly higher than random guesses, 0.20 (PR-Curve) AUC, 0.21 and 0.21 precision and recall, and subsequently lead to strong relevant tests that kill 45%more relevant mutants than randomly sampled mutants (either sampled from those residing on the changed component(s) or from the changed lines). Our results also show that MuDelta selects mutants with 27% higher fault revealing ability in fault introducing commits. Taken together, our results corroborate the conclusion that commit-based mutation testing is suitable and promising for evolving software.",

    "abstract": "Various proxy metrics for test quality have been defined in order to guide developers when writing tests. Code coverage is particularly well established in practice, even though the question of how coverage relates to test quality is a matter of ongoing debate. Mutation testing offers a promising alternative: Artificial defects can identify holes in a test suite, and thus provide concrete suggestions for additional tests. Despite the obvious advantages of mutation testing, it is not yet well established in practice. Until recently, mutation testing tools and techniques simply did not scale to complex systems. Although they now do scale, a remaining obstacle is lack of evidence that writing tests for mutants actually improves test quality. In this paper we aim to fill this gap: By analyzing a large dataset of almost 15 million mutants, we investigate how these mutants influenced developers over time, and how these mutants relate to real faults. Our analyses suggest that developers using mutation testing write more tests, and actively improve their test suites with high quality tests such that fewer mutants remain. By analyzing a dataset of past fixes of real high-priority faults, our analyses further provide evidence that mutants are indeed coupled with real faults. In other words, had mutation testing been used for the changes introducing the faults, it would have reported a live mutant that could have prevented the bug.",

User reviews indicate a rich source of information to plan such feature maintenance activities, and it could be of great benefit for developers to evaluate and magnify the contribution of specific features to the overall success of their apps. In this study, we refer to the features that are highly correlated to app ratings as key features, and we present KEFE, a novel approach that leverages app description and user reviews to identify key features of a given app. The application of KEFE especially relies on natural language processing, deep machine learning classifier, and regression analysis technique, which involves three main steps: 1) extracting feature-describing phrases from app description; 2) matching each app feature with its relevant user reviews; and 3) building a regression model to identify features that have significant relationships with app ratings. To train and evaluate KEFE, we collect 200 app descriptions and 1,108,148 user reviews from Chinese Apple App Store. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of KEFE in feature extraction, where an average F-measure of 78.13% is achieved.

Although most app markets have enforced a number of automated or even manual mechanisms to vet each app before it is released to the market, thousands of low-quality apps still exist in different markets, some of which violate the explicitly specified market policies. In order to identify these violations accurately and timely, we resort to user comments, which can form an immediate feedback for app market maintainers, to identify undesired behaviors that violate market policies, including security-related user concerns. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study to detect and characterize the correlations between user comments and market policies. First, we propose CHAMP, an approach that adopts text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic rules through a semi-automated process, and classifies comments into 26 pre-defined types of undesired behaviors that violate market policies. Our evaluation on real-world user comments shows that it achieves both high precision and recall (>0.9) in classifying comments for undesired behaviors. Then, we curate a large-scale comment dataset (over 3 million user comments) from apps in Google Play and 8 popular alternative Android app markets, and apply CHAMP to understand the characteristics of undesired behavior comments in the wild. The results confirm our speculation that user comments can be used to pinpoint suspicious apps that violate policies declared by app markets. The study also reveals that policy violations are widespread in many app markets despite their extensive vetting efforts. CHAMP can be a whistle blower that assigns policy-violation scores and identifies most informative comments for apps.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourced testing is increasingly dominant in mobile application (app) testing, but it is a great burden for app developers to inspect the incredible number of test reports. Many researches have been proposed to deal with test reports based only on texts or additionally simple image features. However, in mobile app testing, texts contained in test reports are condensed and the information is inadequate. Many screenshots are included as complements that contain much richer information beyond texts. This trend motivates us to prioritize crowdsourced test reports based on a deep screenshot understanding. In this paper, we present a novel crowdsourced test report prioritization approach, namely DeepPrior. We fifirstrst represent the crowdsourced test reports with a novelly introduced feature, namely DeepFeature, that includes all the widgets along with their texts, coordinates, types, and even intents based on the deep analysis of the app screenshots, and the textual descriptions in the crowdsourced test reports. DeepFeature includes the BugFeature, which directly describes the bugs, and the ContextFeature, which depicts the thorough context of the bug. The similarity of the DeepFeature is used to represent the test reports' similarity and prioritize the crowdsourced test reports. We formally define the similarity as DeepSimilarity. We also conduct an empirical experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique with a large dataset group. The results show that DeepPrior is promising, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art approach with less than half the overhead.",

    "abstract": "When a bug manifests in a user-facing application, it is likely to be exposed through the graphical user interface (GUI). Given the importance of visual information to the process of identifying and understanding such bugs, users are increasingly making use of screenshots and screen-recordings as a means to report issues to developers. However, when such information is reported en masse, such as during crowd-sourced testing, managing these artifacts can be a time-consuming process. As the reporting of screen-recordings in particular becomes more popular, developers are likely to face challenges related to manually identifying videos that depict duplicate bugs. Due to their graphical nature, screen-recordings present challenges for automated analysis that preclude the use of current duplicate bug report detection techniques. To overcome these challenges and aid developers in this task, this paper presents Tango, a duplicate detection technique that operates purely on video-based bug reports by leveraging both visual and textual information. Tango combines tailored computer vision techniques, optical character recognition, and text retrieval. We evaluated multiple configurations of Tango in a comprehensive empirical evaluation on 4,860 duplicate detection tasks that involved a total of 180 screen-recordings from six Android apps. Additionally, we conducted a user study investigating the effort required for developers to manually detect duplicate video-based bug reports and compared this to the effort required to use Tango. The results reveal that Tango's optimal configuration is highly effective at detecting duplicate video-based bug reports, accurately ranking target duplicate videos in the top-2 returned results in 83% of the tasks. Additionally, our user study shows that, on average, Tango can reduce developer effort by over 60%, illustrating its practicality.",

    "abstract": "Although Open Source Software (OSS) maintainers devote a significant proportion of their work to coding tasks, great maintainers must excel in many other activities beyond coding. Maintainers should care about fostering a community, helping new members to find their place, while also saying \"no\" to patches that although are well-coded and well-tested, do not contribute to the goal of the project. To perform all these activities masterfully, maintainers should exercise attributes that software engineers (working on closed source projects) do not always need to master. This paper aims to uncover, relate, and prioritize the unique attributes that great OSS maintainers might have. To achieve this goal, we conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with well-experienced maintainers that are the gatekeepers of notable projects such as the Linux Kernel, the Debian operating system, and the GitLab coding platform. After we analyzed the interviews and curated a list of attributes, we created a conceptual framework to explain how these attributes are connected. We then conducted a rating survey with 90 OSS contributors. We noted that \"technical excellence\" and \"communication\" are the most recurring attributes. When grouped, these attributes fit into four broad categories: management, social, technical, and personality. While we noted that \"sustain a long term vision of the project\" and being \"extremely careful\" seem to form the basis of our framework, we noted through our survey that the communication attribute was perceived as the most essential one.",

Aim: We aim to address this knowledge gap by proposing and constructing the Skill Space where each API, developer, and project is represented and postulate how the topology of this space should reflect what developers know (and projects need). Method: we use the World of Code infrastructure to extract the complete set of APIs in the files changed by open source developers and, based on that data, employ Doc2Vec embeddings for vector representations of APIs, developers, and projects. We then evaluate if these embeddings reflect the postulated topology of the Skill Space by predicting what new APIs/projects developers use/join, and whether or not their pull requests get accepted. We also check how the developers' representations in the Skill Space align with their self-reported API expertise. Result: Our results suggest that the proposed embeddings in the Skill Space appear to satisfy the postulated topology and we hope that such representations may aid in the construction of signals that increase trust (and efficiency) of open source ecosystems at large and may aid investigations of other phenomena related to developer proficiency and learning.",

    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402135",
    "abstract": "A sound Decision-Making (DM) process is key to the successful governance of software projects. In many Open Source Software Development (OSSD) communities, DM processes lie buried amongst vast amounts of publicly available data. Hidden within this data lie the rationale for decisions that led to the evolution and maintenance of software products. While there have been some efforts to extract DM processes from publicly available data, the rationale behind 'how' the decisions are made have seldom been explored. Extracting the rationale for these decisions can facilitate transparency (by making them known), and also promote accountability on the part of decision-makers. This work bridges this gap by means of a large-scale study that unearths the rationale behind decisions from Python development email archives comprising about 1.5 million emails. This paper makes two main contributions. First, it makes a knowledge contribution by unearthing and presenting the rationale behind decisions made. Second, it makes a methodological contribution by presenting a heuristics-based rationale extraction system called Rationale Miner that employs multiple heuristics, and follows a data-driven, bottom-up approach to infer the rationale behind specific decisions (e.g., whether a new module is implemented based on core developer consensus or benevolent dictator's pronouncement). Our approach can be applied to extract rationale in other OSSD communities that have similar governance structures.",

    "abstract": "When inspiring software developers to contribute to open source software, the act is often referenced as an opportunity to build tools to support the developer community. However, that is not the only charge that propels contributions-growing interest in open source has also been attributed to software developers deciding to use their technical skills to benefit a common societal good. To understand how developers identify these projects, their motivations for contributing, and challenges they face, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with OSS for Social Good (OSS4SG) contributors. From our interview analysis, we identified themes of contribution styles that we wanted to understand at scale by deploying a survey to over 5765 OSS and Open Source Software for Social Good contributors. From our quantitative analysis of 517 responses, we find that the majority of contributors demonstrate a distinction between OSS4SG and OSS. Likewise, contributors described definitions based on what societal issue the project was to mitigate and who the outcomes of the project were going to benefit. In addition, we find that OSS4SG contributors focus less on benefiting themselves by padding their resume with new technology skills and are more interested in leaving their mark on society at statistically significant levels. We also find that OSS4SG contributors evaluate the owners of the project significantly more than OSS contributors. These findings inform implications to help contributors identify high societal impact projects, help project maintainers reduce barriers to entry, and help organizations understand why contributors are drawn to these projects to sustain active participation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing success of open-source software ecosystems (SECOs), their sustainability depends on the recruitment and involvement of ever-larger contributors. As such, onboarding, i.e., the socio-technical adaptation of new contributors to a SECO, forms a significant aspect of a SECO's growth that requires substantial resources. Unfortunately, despite theoretical models and initial user studies to examine the potential benefits of onboarding, little is known about the process of SECO onboarding, nor about the socio-technical benefits and drawbacks of contributors' onboarding experience in a SECO. To address these, we first carry out an observational study of 72 new contributors during an OpenStack onboarding event to provide a catalog of teaching content, teaching strategies, onboarding challenges, and expected benefits. Next, we empirically validate the extent to which diversity, productivity, and quality benefits are achieved by mining code changes, reviews, and contributors' issues with(out) OpenStack onboarding experience. Among other findings, our study shows a significant correlation with increasing gender diversity (65% for both females and non-binary contributors) and patch acceptance rates (13.5%). Onboarding also has a significant negative correlation with the time until a contributor's first commit and bug-proneness of contributions.",

    "abstract": "Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the last decade, with OSS projects now producing a large ecosystem of popular products, involving industry participation, and providing professional career opportunities. But our field's understanding of what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals' personal growth as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals' demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.",

    "abstract": "Many modern software systems are highly configurable, allowing the user to tune them for performance and more. Current performance modeling approaches aim at finding performance-optimal configurations by building performance models in a black-box manner. While these models provide accurate estimates, they cannot pinpoint causes of observed performance behavior to specific code regions. This does not only hinder system understanding, but it also complicates tracing the influence of configuration options to individual methods. We propose a white-box approach that models configuration-dependent performance behavior at the method level. This allows us to predict the influence of configuration decisions on individual methods, supporting system understanding and performance debugging. The approach consists of two steps: First, we use a coarse-grained profiler and learn performance-influence models for all methods, potentially identifying some methods that are highly configuration-and performance-sensitive, causing inaccurate predictions. Second, we re-measure these methods with a fine-grained profiler and learn more accurate models, at higher cost, though. By means of 9 real-world Java software systems, we demonstrate that our approach can efficiently identify configuration-relevant methods and learn accurate performance-influence models.",

    "abstract": "Static data flow analysis is an integral building block for many applications, ranging from compile-time code optimization to security and privacy analysis. When assessing whether a mobile app is trustworthy, for example, analysts need to identify which of the user's personal data is sent to external parties such as the app developer or cloud providers. Since accessing and sending data is usually done via API calls, tracking the data flow between source and sink API is often the method of choice. Precise algorithms such as IFDS help reduce the number of false positives, but also introduce significant performance penalties. With its fixpoint iteration over the program's entire exploded supergraph, IFDS is particularly memory-intensive, consuming hundreds of megabytes or even several gigabytes for medium-sized apps. In this paper, we present a technique called CleanDroid for reducing the memory footprint of a precise IFDS-based data flow analysis and demonstrate its effectiveness in the popular FlowDroid open-source data flow solver. CleanDroid efficiently removes edges from the path edge table used for the IFDS fixpoint iteration without affecting termination. As we show on 600 realworld Android apps from the Google Play Store, CleanDroid reduces the average per-app memory consumption by around 63% to 78%. At the same time, CleanDroid speeds up the analysis by up to 66%.",

To address this problem, we propose SHIPWRIGHT, a human-in-the-loop system for finding repairs to broken Dockerfiles. SHIPWRIGHT uses a modified version of the BERT language model to embed build logs and to cluster broken Dockerfiles. Using these clusters and a search-based procedure, we were able to design 13 rules for making automated repairs to Dockerfiles. With the aid of SHIPWRIGHT, we submitted 45 pull requests (with a 42.2% acceptance rate) to GitHub projects with broken Dockerfiles. Furthermore, in a \"time-travel\" analysis of broken Dockerfiles that were later fixed, we found that SHIPWRIGHT proposed repairs that were equivalent to human-authored patches in 22.77% of the cases we studied. Finally, we compared our work with recent, state-of-the-art, static Dockerfile analyses, and found that, while static tools detected possible build-failure-inducing issues in 20.6-33.8% of the files we examined, SHIPWRIGHT was able to detect possible issues in 73.25% of the files and, additionally, provide automated repairs for 18.9% of the files.",

    "abstract": "Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to improve software reliability. Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) techniques have been used to automatically fix software bugs. While promising, these approaches have two major limitations. Their search space often does not contain the correct fix, and their search strategy ignores software knowledge such as strict code syntax. Due to these limitations, existing NMT-based techniques underperform the best template-based approaches. We propose CURE, a new NMT-based APR technique with three major novelties. First, CURE pre-trains a programming language (PL) model on a large software codebase to learn developer-like source code before the APR task. Second, CURE designs a new code-aware search strategy that finds more correct fixes by focusing on searching for compilable patches and patches that are close in length to the buggy code. Finally, CURE uses a subword tokenization technique to generate a smaller search space that contains more correct fixes. Our evaluation on two widely-used benchmarks shows that CURE correctly fixes 57 Defects4J bugs and 26 QuixBugs bugs, outperforming all existing APR techniques on both benchmarks.",

Despite the foundational role of AST mapping algorithms, little effort has been made to evaluate the accuracy of AST mapping algorithms, i.e., the extent to which an algorithm captures the evolution of code. We observe that a program element often has only one best-mapped program element. Based on this observation, we propose a hierarchical approach to automatically compare the similarity of mapped statements and tokens by different algorithms. By performing the comparison, we determine if each of the compared algorithms generates inaccurate mappings for a statement or its tokens. We invite 12 external experts to determine if three commonly used AST mapping algorithms generate accurate mappings for a statement and its tokens for 200 statements. Based on the experts' feedback, we observe that our approach achieves a precision of 0.98-1.00 and a recall of 0.65-0.75. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale study with a dataset of ten Java projects containing a total of 263,165 file revisions. Our approach determines that GumTree, MTDiff and IJM generate inaccurate mappings for 20%-29%, 25%-36% and 21%-30% of the file revisions, respectively.

    "abstract": "Learning code representations has found many uses in software engineering, such as code classification, code search, comment generation, and bug prediction, etc. Although representations of code in tokens, syntax trees, dependency graphs, paths in trees, or the combinations of their variants have been proposed, existing learning techniques have a major limitation that these models are often trained on datasets labeled for specific downstream tasks, and as such the code representations may not be suitable for other tasks. Even though some techniques generate representations from unlabeled code, they are far from being satisfactory when applied to the downstream tasks. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes InferCode, which adapts the self-supervised learning idea from natural language processing to the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of code. The novelty lies in the training of code representations by predicting subtrees automatically identified from the contexts of ASTs. With InferCode, subtrees in ASTs are treated as the labels for training the code representations without any human labelling effort or the overhead of expensive graph construction, and the trained representations are no longer tied to any specific downstream tasks or code units. We have trained an instance of InferCode model using Tree-Based Convolutional Neural Network (TBCNN) as the encoder of a large set of Java code. This pre-trained model can then be applied to downstream unsupervised tasks such as code clustering, code clone detection, cross-language code search, or be reused under a transfer learning scheme to continue training the model weights for supervised tasks such as code classification and method name prediction. Compared to prior techniques applied to the same downstream tasks, such as code2vec, code2seq, ASTNN, using our pre-trained InferCode model higher performance is achieved with a significant margin for most of the tasks, including those involving different programming languages.

    "abstract": "A typical compiler such as GCC supports hundreds of optimizations controlled by compilation flags for improving the runtime performance of the compiled program. Due to the large number of compilation flags and the exponential number of flag combinations, it is impossible for compiler users to manually tune these optimization flags in order to achieve the required runtime performance of the compiled programs. Over the years, many compiler autotuning approaches have been proposed to automatically tune optimization flags, but they still suffer from the efficiency problem due to the huge search space. In this paper, we propose the first Bayesian optimization based approach, called BOCA, for efficient compiler autotuning. In BOCA, we leverage a tree-based model for approximating the objective function in order to make Bayesian optimization scalable to a large number of optimization flags. Moreover, we design a novel searching strategy to improve the efficiency of Bayesian optimization by incorporating the impact of each optimization flag measured by the tree-based model and a decay function to strike a balance between exploitation and exploration. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of BOCA on two most popular C compilers (i.e., GCC and LLVM) and two widely-used C benchmarks (i.e., cBench and PolyBench). The results show that BOCA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art compiler autotuning approaches and Bayesion optimization methods in terms of the time spent on achieving specified speedups, demonstrating the effectiveness of BOCA.",

    "abstract": "Software reliability is a primary concern in the construction of software, and thus a fundamental component in the definition of software quality. Analyzing software reliability requires a specification of the intended behavior of the software under analysis, and at the source code level, such specifications typically take the form of assertions. Unfortunately, software many times lacks such specifications, or only provides them for scenario-specific behaviors, as assertions accompanying tests. This issue seriously diminishes the analyzability of software with respect to its reliability. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a technique that, given a Java method, automatically produces a specification of the method's current behavior, in the form of postcondition assertions. This mechanism is based on generating executions of the method under analysis to obtain valid pre/post state pairs, mutating these pairs to obtain (allegedly) invalid ones, and then using a genetic algorithm to produce an assertion that is satisfied by the valid pre/post pairs, while leaving out the invalid ones. The technique, which targets in particular methods of reference-based class implementations, is assessed on a benchmark of open source Java projects, showing that our genetic algorithm is able to generate post-conditions that are stronger and more accurate, than those generated by related automated approaches, as evaluated by an automated oracle assessment tool. Moreover, our technique is also able to infer an important part of manually written rich postconditions in verified classes, and reproduce contracts for methods whose class implementations were automatically synthesized from specifications.",

    "abstract": "Inline assembly is still a common practice in low-level C programming, typically for efficiency reasons or for accessing specific hardware resources. Such embedded assembly codes in the GNU syntax (supported by major compilers such as GCC, Clang and ICC) have an interface specifying how the assembly codes interact with the C environment. For simplicity reasons, the compiler treats GNU inline assembly codes as blackboxes and relies only on their interface to correctly glue them into the compiled C code. Therefore, the adequacy between the assembly chunk and its interface (named compliance) is of primary importance, as such compliance issues can lead to subtle and hard-to-find bugs. We propose RUSTInA, the first automated technique for formally checking inline assembly compliance, with the extra ability to propose (proven) patches and (optimization) refinements in certain cases. RUSTInA is based on an original formalization of the inline assembly compliance problem together with novel dedicated algorithms. Our prototype has been evaluated on 202 Debian packages with inline assembly (2656 chunks), finding 2183 issues in 85 packages – 986 significant issues in 54 packages (including major projects such as ffmpeg or ALSA), and proposing patches for 92% of them.

This allows to engage partial replication mechanisms for error detection/correction at the warp level. By exploring 12 benchmarks (17 kernels) from 4 benchmark suites, we illustrate that threads can be remapped into reliable or unreliable warps with only 1.63% introduced overhead (on average), and then enable selective protection via replication to those groups of threads that truly need it. Furthermore, we show that thread remapping to different warps does not sacrifice application performance. We show how this remapping facilitates warp replication for error detection and/or correction and achieves average reduction of 20.61% and 27.15% execution cycles, respectively comparing to standard duplication/triplication.",

    "abstract": "Virtual conversational assistants designed specifically for software engineers could have a huge impact on the time it takes for software engineers to get help. Research efforts are focusing on virtual assistants that support specific software development tasks such as bug repair and pair programming. In this paper, we study the use of online chat platforms as a resource towards collecting developer opinions that could potentially help in building opinion Q&A systems, as a specialized instance of virtual assistants and chatbots for software engineers. Opinion Q&A has a stronger presence in chats than in other developer communications, thus mining them can provide a valuable resource for developers in quickly getting insight about a specific development topic (e.g., What is the best Java library for parsing JSON?). We address the problem of opinion Q&A extraction by developing automatic identification of opinion-asking questions and extraction of participants' answers from public online developer chats. We evaluate our automatic approaches on chats spanning six programming communities and two platforms. Our results show that a heuristic approach to opinion-asking questions works well (.87 precision), and a deep learning approach customized to the software domain outperforms heuristics-based, machine-learning-based and deep learning for answer extraction in community question answering.",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402151",
    "abstract": "As a popular Q&A site for programming, Stack Overflow is a treasure for developers. However, the amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow make it difficult for developers to efficiently locate the information they are looking for. There are two gaps leading to poor search results: the gap between the user's intention and the textual query, and the semantic gap between the query and the post content. Therefore, developers have to constantly reformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to certain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is tedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated software-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With query logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query reformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding reformulated ones. Our approach trains a Transformer model that can automatically generate candidate reformulated queries when given the user's original query. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a 5.6% to 33.5% boost in terms of ExactMatch and a 4.8% to 14.4% boost in terms of GLEU.",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401996",
    "abstract": "The causes of software crashes can be hidden anywhere in the source code and development environment. When encountering software crashes, recurring bugs that are discussed on Q&A sites could provide developers with solutions to their crashing problems. However, it is difficult for developers to accurately search for relevant content on search engines, and developers have to spend a lot of manual effort to find the right solution from the returned results. In this paper, we present CRASOLVER, an approach that takes into account both the structural information of crash traces and the knowledge of crash-causing bugs to automatically summarize solutions from crash traces. Given a crash trace, CRASOLVER retrieves relevant questions from Q&A sites by combining a proposed position dependent similarity - based on the structural information of the crash trace - with an extra knowledge similarity, based on the knowledge from official documentation sites. After obtaining the answers to these questions from the Q&A site, CRASOLVER summarizes the final solution based on a multi-factor scoring mechanism. To evaluate our approach, we built two repositories of Java and Android exception-related questions from Stack Overflow with size of 69,478 and 33,566 questions respectively. Our user study results using 50 selected Java crash traces and 50 selected Android crash traces show that our approach significantly outperforms four baselines in terms of relevance, usefulness, and diversity. The evaluation also confirms the effectiveness of the relevant question retrieval component in our approach for crash traces.",

    "abstract": "Regulations, standards, and guidelines for safety-critical systems stipulate stringent traceability but do not prescribe the corresponding, detailed software engineering process. Given the industrial practice of using only semi-formal notations to describe engineering processes, processes are rarely \"executable\" and developers have to spend significant manual effort in ensuring that they follow the steps mandated by quality assurance. The size and complexity of systems and regulations makes manual, timely feedback from Quality Assurance (QA) engineers infeasible. In this paper we propose a novel framework for tracking processes in the background, automatically checking QA constraints depending on process progress, and informing the developer of unfulfilled QA constraints. We evaluate our approach by applying it to two different case studies; one open source community system and a safety-critical system in the air-traffic control domain. Results from the analysis show that trace links are often corrected or completed after the fact and thus timely and automated constraint checking support has significant potential on reducing rework.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging computation platform known for their safety-critical need. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a widely used open-source UAV software framework, Paparazzi, with the goal of understanding the safety-critical concerns of UAV software from a bottom-up developer-in-the-field perspective. We set our focus on the use of Bounding Functions (BFs), the runtime checks injected by Paparazzi developers on the range of variables. Through an in-depth analysis on BFs in the Paparazzi autopilot software, we found a large number of them (109 instances) are used to bound safety-critical variables essential to the cyber-physical nature of the UAV, such as its thrust, its speed, and its sensor values. The novel contributions of this study are two fold. First, we take a static approach to classify all BF instances, presenting a novel datatype-based 5-category taxonomy with fine-grained insight on the role of BFs in ensuring the safety of UAV systems. Second, we dynamically evaluate the impact of the BF uses through a differential approach, establishing the UAV behavioral difference with and without BFs. The two-pronged static and dynamic approach together illuminates a rarely studied design space of safety-critical UAV software systems.",

    "abstract": "Genetic improvement uses artificial intelligence to automatically improve software with respect to non-functional properties (AI for SE). In this paper, we propose the use of existing software engineering best practice to enhance Genetic Improvement (SE for AI). We conjecture that existing Regression Test Selection (RTS) techniques (which have been proven to be efficient and effective) can and should be used as a core component of the GI search process for maximising its effectiveness. To assess our idea, we have carried out a thorough empirical study assessing the use of both dynamic and static RTS techniques with GI to improve seven real-world software programs. The results of our empirical evaluation show that incorporation of RTS within GI significantly speeds up the whole GI process, making it up to 78% faster on our benchmark set, being still able to produce valid software improvements. Our findings are significant in that they can save hours to days of computational time, and can facilitate the uptake of GI in an industrial setting, by significantly reducing the time for the developer to receive feedback from such an automated technique. Therefore, we recommend the use of RTS in future test-based automated software improvement work. Finally, we hope this successful application of SE for AI will encourage other researchers to investigate further applications in this area.",

This offers the opportunity to enforce least-privilege design per package, protecting applications and package dependencies from malicious updates. We propose a lightweight permission system that protects Node.js applications by enforcing package permissions at runtime. We discuss the design space of solutions and show that our system makes a large number of packages much harder to be exploited, almost for free.",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402004",
    "abstract": "Android apps include third-party native libraries to increase performance and to reuse functionality. Native code is directly executed from apps through the Java Native Interface or the Android Native Development Kit. Android developers add precompiled native libraries to their projects, enabling their use. Unfortunately, developers often struggle or simply neglect to update these libraries in a timely manner. This results in the continuous use of outdated native libraries with unpatched security vulnerabilities years after patches became available. To further understand such phenomena, we study the security updates in native libraries in the most popular 200 free apps on Google Play from Sept. 2013 to May 2020. A core difficulty we face in this study is the identification of libraries and their versions. Developers often rename or modify libraries, making their identification challenging. We create an approach called LibRARIAN (LibRAry veRsion IdentificAtioN) that accurately identifies native libraries and their versions as found in Android apps based on our novel similarity metric bin2sim. LibRARIAN leverages different features extracted from libraries based on their metadata and identifying strings in read-only sections. We discovered 53/200 popular apps (26.5%) with vulnerable versions with known CVEs between Sept. 2013 and May 2020, with 14 of those apps remaining vulnerable. We find that app developers took, on average, 528.71±40.20 days to apply security patches, while library developers release a security patch after 54.59 ± 8.12 days-a 10 times slower rate of update.",

    "abstract": "With tons of efforts spent on its mitigation, Cross-site scripting (XSS) remains one of the most prevalent security threats on the internet. Decades of exploitation and remediation demonstrated that code inspection and testing alone does not eliminate XSS vulnerabilities in complex web applications with a high degree of confidence. This paper introduces Google's secure-by-design engineering paradigm that effectively prevents DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in large-scale web development. Our approach, named API hardening, enforces a series of company-wide secure coding practices. We provide a set of secure APIs to replace native DOM APIs that are prone to XSS vulnerabilities. Through a combination of type contracts and appropriate validation and escaping, the secure APIs ensure that applications based thereon are free of XSS vulnerabilities. We deploy a simple yet capable compile-time checker to guarantee that developers exclusively use our hardened APIs to interact with the DOM. We make various of efforts to scale this approach to tens of thousands of engineers without significant productivity impact. By offering rigorous tooling and consultant support, we help developers adopt the secure coding practices as seamlessly as possible. We present empirical results showing how API hardening has helped reduce the occurrences of XSS vulnerabilities in Google's enormous code base over the course of two-year deployment.",

    "abstract": "Peer code review has been found to be effective in identifying security vulnerabilities. However, despite practicing mandatory code reviews, many Open Source Software (OSS) projects still encounter a large number of post-release security vulnerabilities, as some security defects escape those. Therefore, a project manager may wonder if there was any weakness or inconsistency during a code review that missed a security vulnerability. Answers to this question may help a manager pinpointing areas of concern and taking measures to improve the effectiveness of his/her project's code reviews in identifying security defects. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors that differentiate code reviews that successfully identified security defects from those that missed such defects. With this goal, we conduct a case-control study of Chromium OS project. Using multi-stage semi-automated approaches, we build a dataset of 516 code reviews that successfully identified security defects and 374 code reviews where security defects escaped. The results of our empirical study suggest that the are significant differences between the categories of security defects that are identified and that are missed during code reviews. A logistic regression model fitted on our dataset achieved an AUC score of 0.91 and has identified nine code review attributes that influence identifications of security defects. While time to complete a review, the number of mutual reviews between two developers, and if the review is for a bug fix have positive impacts on vulnerability identification, opposite effects are observed from the number of directories under review, the number of total reviews by a developer, and the total number of prior commits for the file under review.",

    "abstract": "In finance, leverage is the ratio between assets borrowed from others and one's own assets. A matching situation is present in software: by using free open-source software (FOSS) libraries a developer leverages on other people's code to multiply the offered functionalities with a much smaller own codebase. In finance as in software, leverage magnifies profits when returns from borrowing exceed costs of integration, but it may also magnify losses, in particular in the presence of security vulnerabilities. We aim to understand the level of technical leverage in the FOSS ecosystem and whether it can be a potential source of security vulnerabilities. Also, we introduce two metrics change distance and change direction to capture the amount and the evolution of the dependency on third-party libraries. The application of the proposed metrics on 8494 distinct library versions from the FOSS Maven-based Java libraries shows that small and medium libraries (less than 100KLoC) have disproportionately more leverage on FOSS dependencies in comparison to large libraries. We show that leverage pays off as leveraged libraries only add a 4% delay in the time interval between library releases while providing four times more code than their own. However, libraries with such leverage (i.e., 75% of libraries in our sample) also have 1.6 higher odds of being vulnerable in comparison to the libraries with lower leverage. We provide an online demo for computing the proposed metrics for real-world software libraries available under the following URL: https://techleverage.eu/.",

    "abstract": "Inter-Component Communication (ICC) is a key mechanism in Android. It enables developers to compose rich functionalities and explore reuse within and across apps. Unfortunately, as reported by a large body of literature, ICC is rather \"complex and largely unconstrained\", leaving room to a lack of precision in apps modeling. To address the challenge of tracking ICCs within apps, state of the art static approaches such as EPICC, ICCTA and AMANDROID have focused on the documented framework ICC methods (e.g., startActivity) to build their approaches. In this work we show that ICC models inferred in these state of the art tools may actually be incomplete: the framework provides other atypical ways of performing ICCs. To address this limitation in the state of the art, we propose RAICC a static approach for modeling new ICC links and thus boosting previous analysis tasks such as ICC vulnerability detection, privacy leaks detection, malware detection, etc. We have evaluated RAICC on 20 benchmark apps, demonstrating that it improves the precision and recall of uncovered leaks in state of the art tools. We have also performed a large empirical investigation showing that Atypical ICC methods are largely used in Android apps, although not necessarily for data transfer. We also show that RAICC increases the number of ICC links found by 61.6% on a dataset of real-world malicious apps, and that RAICC enables the detection of new ICC vulnerabilities.",

Importantly, and contrary to widely-held beliefs that greater fairness often corresponds to lower accuracy, our findings reveal that an enlarged feature set has both higher accuracy and fairness. Perhaps also surprisingly, we find that a larger training data does not help to improve fairness.

Log-based anomaly detection is one of the most important methods for such purpose, which aims to automatically detect system anomalies via log analysis. However, existing log-based anomaly detection approaches still suffer from practical issues due to either depending on a large amount of manually labeled training data (supervised approaches) or unsatisfactory performance without learning the knowledge on historical anomalies (unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches). In this paper, we propose a novel practical log-based anomaly detection approach, PLELog, which is semi-supervised to get rid of time-consuming manual labeling and incorporates the knowledge on historical anomalies via probabilistic label estimation to bring supervised approaches' superiority into play. In addition, PLELog is able to stay immune to unstable log data via semantic embedding and detect anomalies efficiently and effectively by designing an attention-based GRU neural network. We evaluated PLELog on two most widely-used public datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of PLELog, significantly outperforming the compared approaches with an average of 181.6% improvement in terms of F1-score. In particular, PLELog has been applied to two real-world systems from our university and a large corporation, further demonstrating its practicability",

    "abstract": "Developers write logging statements to generate logs that provide valuable runtime information for debugging and maintenance of software systems. Log level is an important component of a logging statement, which enables developers to control the information to be generated at system runtime. However, due to the complexity of software systems and their runtime behaviors, deciding a proper log level for a logging statement is a challenging task. For example, choosing a higher level (e.g., error) for a trivial event may confuse end users and increase system maintenance overhead, while choosing a lower level (e.g., trace) for a critical event may prevent the important execution information to be conveyed opportunely. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by first conducting a preliminary manual study on the characteristics of log levels. We find that the syntactic context of the logging statement and the message to be logged might be related to the decision of log levels, and log levels that are further apart in order (e.g., trace and error) tend to have more differences in their characteristics. Based on this, we then propose a deep-learning based approach that can leverage the ordinal nature of log levels to make suggestions on choosing log levels, by using the syntactic context and message features of the logging statements extracted from the source code. Through an evaluation on nine large-scale open source projects, we find that: 1) our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline approaches; 2) we can further improve the performance of our approach by enlarging the training data obtained from other systems; 3) our approach also achieves promising results on cross-system suggestions that are even better than the baseline approaches on within-system suggestions.

    "abstract": "The boundary conditions (BCs) have shown great potential in requirements engineering because a BC captures the particular combination of circumstances, i.e., divergence, in which the goals of the requirement cannot be satisfied as a whole. Existing researches have attempted to automatically identify lots of BCs. Unfortunately, a large number of identified BCs make assessing and resolving divergences expensive. Existing methods adopt a coarse-grained metric, generality, to filter out less general BCs. However, the results still retain a large number of redundant BCs since a general BC potentially captures redundant circumstances that do not lead to a divergence. Furthermore, the likelihood of BC can be misled by redundant BCs resulting in costly repeatedly assessing and resolving divergences. In this paper, we present a fine-grained metric to filter out the redundant BCs. We first introduce the concept of contrasty of BC. Intuitively, if two BCs are contrastive, they capture different divergences. We argue that a set of contrastive BCs should be recommended to engineers, rather than a set of general BCs that potentially only indicates the same divergence. Then we design a post-processing framework (PPFc) to produce a set of contrastive BCs after identifying BCs. Experimental results show that the contrasty metric dramatically reduces the number of BCs recommended to engineers. Results also demonstrate that lots of BCs identified by the state-of-the-art method are redundant in most cases. Besides, to improve efficiency, we propose a joint framework (JFc) to interleave assessing based on the contrasty metric with identifying BCs. The primary intuition behind JFc is that it considers the search bias toward contrastive BCs during identifying BCs, thereby pruning the BCs capturing the same divergence. Experiments confirm the improvements of JFc in identifying contrastive BCs.",

    "abstract": "Ambiguity in natural-language requirements is a pervasive issue that has been studied by the requirements engineering community for more than two decades. A fully manual approach for addressing ambiguity in requirements is tedious and time-consuming, and may further overlook unacknowledged ambiguity – the situation where different stakeholders perceive a requirement as unambiguous but, in reality, interpret the requirement differently. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that uses natural language processing for handling ambiguity in requirements. Our approach is based on the automatic generation of a domain-specific corpus from Wikipedia. Integrating domain knowledge, as we show in our evaluation, leads to a significant positive improvement in the accuracy of ambiguity detection and interpretation. We scope our work to coordination ambiguity (CA) and prepositional-phrase attachment ambiguity (PAA) because of the prevalence of these types of ambiguity in natural-language requirements [1]. We evaluate our approach on 20 industrial requirements documents. These documents collectively contain more than 5000 requirements from seven distinct application domains. Over this dataset, our approach detects CA and PAA with an average precision of 80% and an average recall of 89% (90% for cases of unacknowledged ambiguity). The automatic interpretations that our approach yields have an average accuracy of 85%. Compared to baselines that use generic corpora, our approach, which uses domain-specific corpora, has 33% better accuracy in ambiguity detection and 16% better accuracy in interpretation.",

Inconsistent documentation is undesirable, since documentation serves as a useful source of information about the functionality. This paper presents a study on the prevalence of function documentations that are indirectly or implicitly dependent on entities other than the associated function. We observe a substantial presence of such documentations, with 62% of the studied Javadoc comments being dependent on other entities, as studied in 11 open-source repositories implemented in Java.

To address these shortcomings, we propose CodeShovel, a tool for uncovering method histories that quickly produces complete and accurate change histories for 90% methods (including 97% of all method changes) outperforming leading tools from both research (e.g, FinerGit) and practice (e.g., IntelliJ / git log). CodeShovel helps developers to navigate the entire history of source code methods so they can better understand how the method evolved. A field study on industrial code bases with 16 industrial developers confirmed our empirical findings of CodeShovel's correctness, low runtime overheads, and additionally showed that the approach can be useful for a wide range of industrial development tasks.",

    "abstract": "Testing Technical Debt (TTD) occurs due to shortcuts (non-optimal decisions) taken about testing; it is the test dimension of technical debt. R is a package-based programming ecosystem that provides an easy way to install third-party code, datasets, tests, documentation and examples. This structure makes it especially vulnerable to TTD because errors present in a package can transitively affect all packages and scripts that depend on it. Thus, TTD can effectively become a threat to the validity of all analysis written in R that rely on potentially faulty code. This two-part study provides the first analysis in this area. First, 177 systematically-selected, open-source R packages were mined and analysed to address quality of testing, testing goals, and identify potential TTD sources. Second, a survey addressed how R package developers perceive testing and face its challenges (response rate of 19.4%). Results show that testing in R packages is of low quality; the most common smells are inadequate and obscure unit testing, improper asserts, inexperienced testers and improper test design. Furthermore, skilled R developers still face challenges such as time constraints, emphasis on development rather than testing, poor tool documentation and a steep learning curve.",

    "abstract": "We introduce, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first approach for systematically testing Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) systems. Our approach leverages differential testing to establish a test oracle for ORM-specific bugs. Specifically, we first generate random relational database schemas, set up the respective databases, and then, we query these databases using the APIs of the ORM systems under test. To tackle the challenge that ORMs lack a common input language, we generate queries written in an abstract query language. These abstract queries are translated into concrete, executable ORM queries, which are ultimately used to differentially test the correctness of target implementations. The effectiveness of our method heavily relies on the data inserted to the underlying databases. Therefore, we employ a solver-based approach for producing targeted database records with respect to the constraints of the generated queries. We implement our approach as a tool, called CYNTHIA, which found 28 bugs in five popular ORM systems. The vast majority of these bugs are confirmed (25 / 28), more than half were fixed (20 / 28), and three were marked as release blockers by the corresponding developers.",

    "abstract": "Automatic unit test generation that explores the input space and produces effective test cases for given programs have been studied for decades. Many unit test generation tools that can help generate unit test cases with high structural coverage over a program have been examined. However, the fact that existing test generation tools are mainly evaluated on general software programs calls into question about its practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning libraries, which are statistically orientated and have fundamentally different nature and construction from general software projects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing unit test generation techniques on machine learning libraries. To investigate this issue, we conducted an empirical study on five widely used machine learning libraries with two popular unit testcase generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE and Randoop. We find that (1) most of the machine learning libraries do not maintain a high-quality unit test suite regarding commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (on average is 34.1%) and mutation score (on average is 21.3%), (2) unit test case generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE and Randoop, lead to clear improvements in code coverage and mutation score, however, the improvement is limited, and (3) there exist common patterns in the uncovered code across the five machine learning libraries that can be used to improve unit test case generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "The fragmentation problem has extended from Android to different platforms, such as iOS, mobile web, and even mini-programs within some applications (app), like WeChat. In such a situation, recording and replaying test scripts is one of the most popular automated mobile app testing approaches. However, such approach encounters severe problems when crossing platforms. Different versions of the same app need to be developed to support different platforms relying on different platform supports. Therefore, mobile app developers need to develop and maintain test scripts for multiple platforms aimed at completely the same test requirements, greatly increasing testing costs. However, we discover that developers adopt highly similar user interface layouts for versions of the same app on different platforms. Such a phenomenon inspires us to replay test scripts from the perspective of similar UI layouts. In this paper, we propose an image-driven mobile app testing framework, utilizing Widget Feature Matching and Layout Characterization Matching to analyze app UIs. We use computer vision (CV) technologies to perform UI feature comparison and layout hierarchy extraction on mobile app screenshots to obtain UI structures containing rich contextual information of app widgets, including coordinates, relative relationship, etc. Based on acquired UI structures, we can form a platform-independent test script, and then locate the target widgets under test. Thus, the proposed framework non-intrusively replays test scripts according to a novel platform-independent test script model. We also design and implement a tool named LIRAT to devote the proposed framework into practice, based on which, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed testing framework. The results show that the overall replay accuracy reaches around 65.85% on Android (8.74% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches) and 35.26% on iOS (35% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches).",

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402098",
    "abstract": "When developers make changes to their code, they typically run regression tests to detect if their recent changes (re) introduce any bugs. However, many tests are flaky, and their outcomes can change non-deterministically, failing without apparent cause. Flaky tests are a significant nuisance in the development process, since they make it more difficult for developers to trust the outcome of their tests, and hence, it is important to know which tests are flaky. The traditional approach to identify flaky tests is to rerun them multiple times: if a test is observed both passing and failing on the same code, it is definitely flaky. We conducted a very large empirical study looking for flaky tests by rerunning the test suites of 24 projects 10,000 times each, and found that even with this many reruns, some previously identified flaky tests were still not detected. We propose FlakeFlagger, a novel approach that collects a set of features describing the behavior of each test, and then predicts tests that are likely to be flaky based on similar behavioral features. We found that FlakeFlagger correctly labeled as flaky at least as many tests as a state-of-the-art flaky test classifier, but that FlakeFlagger reported far fewer false positives. This lower false positive rate translates directly to saved time for researchers and developers who use the classification result to guide more expensive flaky test detection processes. Evaluated on our dataset of 23 projects with flaky tests, FlakeFlagger outperformed the prior approach (by F1 score) on 16 projects and tied on 4 projects. Our results indicate that this approach can be effective for identifying likely flaky tests prior to running time-consuming flaky test detectors.",

This work ignores UI tests that have larger input spaces and more diverse running conditions than traditional unit tests. In addition, UI tests tend to be more complex and resource-heavy, making them unsuited for detection techniques involving rerunning test suites multiple times. In this paper, we perform a study on flaky UI tests. We analyze 235 flaky UI test samples found in 62 projects from both web and Android environments. We identify the common underlying root causes of flakiness in the UI tests, the strategies used to manifest the flaky behavior, and the fixing strategies used to remedy flaky UI tests.

GenTree uses an iterative refinement approach that runs the program under a small sample of configurations to obtain coverage data; uses a custom classifying algorithm on these data to build decision trees representing interaction candidates; and then analyzes the trees to generate new configurations to further refine the trees and interactions in the next iteration. Our experiments on 17 configurable systems spanning 4 languages show that GenTree efficiently finds precise interactions using a tiny fraction of the configuration space.",

Although accessibility has traditionally been a marginal afterthought that is often ignored in many software products, it is increasingly becoming a legal requirement that must be satisfied. While some web accessibility testing tools exist, most only perform rudimentary syntactical checks that do not assess the more important high-level semantic aspects that users with disabilities rely on. Accordingly, assessing web accessibility has largely remained a laborious manual process requiring human input. In this paper, we propose an approach, called AXERAY, that infers semantic groupings of various regions of a web page and their semantic roles. We evaluate our approach on 30 real-world websites and assess the accuracy of semantic inference as well as the ability to detect accessibility failures. The results show that AXERAY achieves, on average, an F-measure of 87% for inferring semantic groupings, and is able to detect accessibility failures with 85% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "API recommendation in real-time is challenging for dynamic languages like Python. Many existing API recommendation techniques are highly effective, but they mainly support static languages. A few Python IDEs provide API recommendation functionalities based on type inference and training on a large corpus of Python libraries and third-party libraries. As such, they may fail to recommend or make poor recommendations when type information is missing or target APIs are project-specific. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, PyART, to recommend APIs for Python programs in real-time. It features a light-weight analysis to derives so-called optimistic data-flow, which is neither sound nor complete, but simulates the local data-flow information humans can derive. It extracts three kinds of features: data-flow, token similarity, and token co-occurrence, in the context of the program point where a recommendation is solicited. A predictive model is trained on these features using the Random Forest algorithm. Evaluation on 8 popular Python projects demonstrates that PyART can provide effective API recommendations. When historic commits can be leveraged, which is the target scenario of a state-of-the-art tool ARIREC, our average top-1 accuracy is over 50% and average top-10 accuracy over 70%, outperforming APIREC and Intellicode (i.e., the recommendation component in Visual Studio) by 28.48%-39.05% for top-1 accuracy and 24.41%-30.49% for top-10 accuracy. In other applications such as when historic comments are not available and cross-project recommendation, PyART also shows better overall performance. The time to make a recommendation is less than a second on average, satisfying the real-time requirement.",

    "abstract": "Call graphs play an important role in different contexts, such as profiling and vulnerability propagation analysis. Generating call graphs in an efficient manner can be a challenging task when it comes to high-level languages that are modular and incorporate dynamic features and higher-order functions. Despite the language's popularity, there have been very few tools aiming to generate call graphs for Python programs. Worse, these tools suffer from several effectiveness issues that limit their practicality in realistic programs. We propose a pragmatic, static approach for call graph generation in Python. We compute all assignment relations between program identifiers of functions, variables, classes, and modules through an inter-procedural analysis. Based on these assignment relations, we produce the resulting call graph by resolving all calls to potentially invoked functions. Notably, the underlying analysis is designed to be efficient and scalable, handling several Python features, such as modules, generators, function closures, and multiple inheritance. We have evaluated our prototype implementation, which we call PyCG, using two benchmarks: a micro-benchmark suite containing small Python programs and a set of macro-benchmarks with several popular real-world Python packages. Our results indicate that PyCG can efficiently handle thousands of lines of code in less than a second (0.38 seconds for 1k LoC on average). Further, it outperforms the state-of-the-art for Python in both precision and recall: PyCG achieves high rates of precision ~99.2% and adequate recall ~69.9%. Finally, we demonstrate how PyCG can aid dependency impact analysis by showcasing a potential enhancement to GitHub's \"security advisory\" notification service using a real-world example.",

    "abstract": "Customization is a general trend in software engineering, demanding systems that support variable stakeholder requirements. Two opposing strategies are commonly used to create variants: software clone&own and software configuration with an integrated platform. Organizations often start with the former, which is cheap, agile, and supports quick innovation, but does not scale. The latter scales by establishing an integrated platform that shares software assets between variants, but requires high up-front investments or risky migration processes. So, could we have a method that allows an easy transition or even combine the benefits of both strategies? We propose a method and tool that supports a truly incremental development of variant rich systems, exploiting a spectrum between both opposing strategies. We design, formalize, and prototype the variability management framework virtual platform. It bridges clone&own and platform-oriented development. Relying on programming language independent conceptual structures representing software assets, it offers operators for engineering and evolving a system, comprising: traditional, asset-oriented operators and novel, feature-oriented operators for incrementally adopting concepts of an integrated platform. The operators record meta-data that is exploited by other operators to support the transition. Among others, they eliminate expensive feature-location effort or the need to trace clones. Our evaluation simulates the evolution of a real-world, clone-based system, measuring its costs and benefits.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental premise of SMS One-Time Password (OTP) is that the used pseudo-random numbers (PRNs) are uniquely unpredictable for each login session. Hence, the process of generating PRNs is the most critical step in the OTP authentication. An improper implementation of the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) will result in predictable or even static OTP values, making them vulnerable to potential attacks. In this paper, we present a vulnerability study against PRNGs implemented for Android apps. A key challenge is that PRNGs are typically implemented on the server-side, and thus the source code is not accessible. To resolve this issue, we build an analysis tool, OTP-Lint, to assess implementations of the PRNGs in an automated manner without the source code requirement. Through reverse engineering, OTP-Lint identifies the apps using SMS OTP and triggers each app's login functionality to retrieve OTP values. It further assesses the randomness of the OTP values to identify vulnerable PRNGs. By analyzing 6,431 commercially used Android apps downloaded from Google Play and Tencent Myapp, OTP-Lint identified 399 vulnerable apps that generate predictable OTP values. Even worse, 194 vulnerable apps use the OTP authentication alone without any additional security mechanisms, leading to insecure authentication against guessing attacks and replay attacks.",

    "abstract": "Limited by the small keyboard, most mobile apps support the automatic login feature for better user experience. Therefore, users avoid the inconvenience of retyping their ID and password when an app runs in the foreground again. However, this auto-login function can be exploited to launch the so-called \"data-clone attack\": once the locally-stored, auto-login depended data are cloned by attackers and placed into their own smartphones, attackers can break through the login-device number limit and log in to the victim's account stealthily. A natural countermeasure is to check the consistency of device-specific attributes. As long as the new device shows different device fingerprints with the previous one, the app will disable the auto-login function and thus prevent data-clone attacks. In this paper, we develop VPDroid, a transparent Android OS-level virtualization platform tailored for security testing. With VPDroid, security analysts can customize different device artifacts, such as CPU model, Android ID, and phone number, in a virtual phone without user-level API hooking. VPDroid's isolation mechanism ensures that user-mode apps in the virtual phone cannot detect device-specific discrepancies. To assess Android apps' susceptibility to the data-clone attack, we use VPDroid to simulate data-clone attacks with 234 most-downloaded apps. Our experiments on five different virtual phone environments show that VPDroid's device attribute customization can deceive all tested apps that perform device-consistency checks, such as Twitter, WeChat, and PayPal. 19 vendors have confirmed our report as a zero-day vulnerability. Our findings paint a cautionary tale: only enforcing a device-consistency check at client side is still vulnerable to an advanced data-clone attack.",

    "abstract": "Third-party libraries (TPLs) as essential parts in the mobile ecosystem have become one of the most significant contributors to the huge success of Android, which facilitate the fast development of Android applications. Detecting TPLs in Android apps is also important for downstream tasks, such as malware and repackaged apps identification. To identify in-app TPLs, we need to solve several challenges, such as TPL dependency, code obfuscation, precise version representation. Unfortunately, existing TPL detection tools have been proved that they have not solved these challenges very well, let alone specify the exact TPL versions. To this end, we propose a system, named ATVHunter, which can pinpoint the precise vulnerable in-app TPL versions and provide detailed information about the vulnerabilities and TPLs. We propose a two-phase detection approach to identify specific TPL versions. Specifically, we extract the Control Flow Graphs as the coarse-grained feature to match potential TPLs in the pre-defined TPL database, and then extract opcode in each basic block of CFG as the fine-grained feature to identify the exact TPL versions. We build a comprehensive TPL database (189,545 unique TPLs with 3,006,676 versions) as the reference database. Meanwhile, to identify the vulnerable in-app TPL versions, we also construct a comprehensive and known vulnerable TPL database containing 1,180 CVEs and 224 security bugs. Experimental results show AtVHunter outperforms state-of-the-art TPL detection tools, achieving 90.55% precision and 88.79% recall with high efficiency, and is also resilient to widely-used obfuscation techniques and scalable for large-scale TPL detection. Furthermore, to investigate the ecosystem of the vulnerable TPLs used by apps, we exploit newtool to conduct a large-scale analysis on 104,446 apps and find that 9,050 apps include vulnerable TPL versions with 53,337 vulnerabilities and 7,480 security bugs, most of which are with high risks and are not recognized by app developers.",

    "abstract": "Java Native Interface (JNI) provides a way for Java applications to access native libraries, but it is difficult to develop correct JNI programs. By leveraging native code, the JNI enables Java developers to implement efficient applications and to reuse code written in other programming languages such as C and C++. Besides, the core Java libraries already use the JNI to provide system features like a graphical user interface. As a result, many mainstream Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) support the JNI. However, due to the complex interoperation semantics between different programming languages, implementing correct JNI programs is not trivial. Moreover, because of the performance overhead, JVMs do not validate erroneous JNI interoperations by default, but they validate them only when the debug feature, the -Xcheck:jni option, is enabled. Therefore, the correctness of JNI programs highly relies on the checks by the -Xcheck:jni option of JVMs. Questions remain, however, on the quality of the checks provided by the feature. Are there any properties that the -Xcheck:jni option fails to validate? If so, what potential issues can arise due to the lack of such validation? To the best of our knowledge, no research has explored these questions in-depth. In this paper, we empirically study the validation quality and impacts of the -Xcheck:jni option on mainstream JVMs using unspecified corner cases in the JNI specification. Such unspecified cases may lead to unexpected run-time behaviors because their semantics is not defined in the specification. For a systematic study, we propose JUSTGEN, a semi-automated approach to identify unspecified cases from a specification and generate test programs. JUSTGEN receives the JNI specification written in our domain specific language (DSL), and automatically discovers unspecified cases using an SMT solver. It then generates test programs that trigger the behaviors of unspecified cases. Using the generated tests, we empirically study the validation ability of the -Xcheck:jni option. Our experimental result shows that the JNI debug feature does not validate thousands of unspecified cases on JVMs, and they can cause critical run-time errors such as violation of the Java type system and memory corruption. We reported 792 unspecified cases that are not validated by JVMs to their corresponding JVM vendors. Among them, 563 cases have been fixed and the remaining cases will be fixed in near future. Based on our empirical study, we believe that the JNI specification should specify the semantics of the missing cases clearly and the debug feature should be supported completely.",
