    "abstract": "In the context of secure information flow, security policies express the classification and declassification of data. Existing policy frameworks are tightly linked to a programming language, which limits their flexibility and complicates reasoning, for instance, during audits. We present a framework for the specification and verification of security policies for distributed systems, where attackers may observe the I/O performed by a program, but not its memory. Our policies are expressed over the I/O behaviors of programs and, thereby, language-agnostic. We present techniques to reason formally about policies, and to verify that an implementation satisfies a given policy. We formalize these verification techniques in Isabelle/HOL. An evaluation on several case studies, including an implementation of the WireGuard VPN key exchange protocol, demonstrates that our policies are expressive, and that verification is amenable to SMT-based verification."

    "abstract": "Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e. elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3\\%."

    "abstract": "Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols are known to be difficult to design and to reason about. To address this challenge, on one hand, several approaches have been developed recently for computer-aided formal verification of the desired correctness properties, both safety and liveness, of standalone BFT protocols. On the other hand, the distributed computing community has made attempts to reduce the conceptual complexity of constructing new such protocols by showing how to assemble them from simpler \"building blocks\". No methodology to date combines these two approaches for foundational verification of arbitrary BFT protocols.We present Bythos, the first foundational framework for compositional mechanised verification of both safety and liveness of composite BFT protocols. Bythos is implemented on top of the Coq proof assistant and uses Coq's higher-order logic to reuse proofs of common facts about knowledge and trust in BFT protocols. It allows for compact liveness specifications in the style of TLA+, and for their proofs using an embedding of TLA into Coq. Most importantly, Bythos provides a family of higher-order definitions that allow building composite BFT protocols from simpler ones, with their correctness proofs derived. We showcase Bythos by verifying in it safety and liveness properties of three basic BFT protocols: Reliable Broadcast, Provable Broadcast, and the recently proposed Accountable Byzantine Confirmer, as well as their compositions."

The significance of BGP for stability and security of the Internet has made it a top priority on the cyber security agenda of the US government, with CISA, FCC, and other federal agencies leading the efforts.To protect against prefix hijacks, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. Yet, RPKI validation is still not widely supported. To enjoy the security guarantees of RPKI, networks need to install a new component, the Relying Party validator, which fetches and validates RPKI objects and provides them to border routers. However, research showed that Relying Parties experience failures when retrieving RPKI objects and are vulnerable to a range of attacks, all of which can disable RPKI validation. Therefore, even the few adopters are not necessarily secure.We propose a Byzantine-secure Relying Party functionality, we call ByzRP, and show that it significantly improves the resilience and security of RPKI validation. With ByzRP, Relying Party nodes redundantly validate RPKI objects and reach a global consensus through a voting process. ByzRP removes the need for networks to install, operate, and upgrade their own Relying Party instances on the one hand, and does not require to trust the individual operators of ByzRP nodes on the other hand.We show through simulations and experimental evaluations that ByzRP, as an intermediate RPKI service, reduces the load on RPKI publication points and produces a robust output, despite RPKI repository failures, jitters, and attacks. We engineer ByzRP to be fully backward compatible and readily deployable - it does not require any changes to border routers and RPKI repositories. We demonstrate that ByzRP can protect networks transparently, either with a decentralized or a centralized deployment and it enables users to independently verify the correctness of its operation."

    "abstract": "Apple silicon is the proprietary ARM-based processor that powers the mainstream of Apple devices. The move to this proprietary architecture presents unique challenges in addressing security issues, requiring huge research efforts into the security of Apple silicon-based systems. In this paper, we study the security of KASLR, the randomization-based kernel hardening technique, on the state-of-the-art macOS system equipped with Apple silicon processors. Because KASLR has been subject to many microarchitectural side-channel attacks, the latest operating systems, including macOS, use kernel isolation, which separates the kernel page table from the userspace table. Kernel isolation in macOS provides a barrier to KASLR break attacks. To overcome this, we exploit speculative execution in system calls. By using Spectre-type gadgets in system calls, an unprivileged attacker can cause translations of the attacker's chosen kernel addresses, causing the TLB to change according to the validity of the address. This allows the construction of an attack primitive that breaks KASLR bypassing kernel isolation. Since the TLB is used as a side-channel source, we reverse-engineer the hidden internals of the TLB on various M-series processors using a hardware performance monitoring unit. Based on our attack primitive, we implement SysBumps, the first KASLR break attack on macOS for Apple silicon. Throughout evaluation, we show that SysBumps can effectively break KASLR across different M-series processors and macOS versions. We also discuss possible mitigations against the proposed attack."

    "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments are a promising solution for solving the data privacy and trust issues introduced by cloud computing. As a result, all major CPU vendors integrated Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) into their CPUs. The biggest threat to TEE security are side-channel attacks, of which single-stepping attacks turned out to be the most powerful ones. Enabled by the TEE attacker model, single-stepping attacks allow the attacker to execute the TEE one instruction at a time, enabling numerous controlled- and side-channel based security issues. Intel recently launched Intel TDX, its second generation TEE, which protects whole virtual machines (VMs). To minimize the attack surface to side-channels, TDX comes with a dedicated single-stepping attack countermeasure. In this paper, we systematically analyze the single-stepping countermeasure of Intel TDX and show, for the first time, that both, the built-in detection heuristic as well as the prevention mechanism, can be circumvented. We reliably single-step TDX-protected VMs by deluding the TDX security monitor about the elapsed processing time used as part of the detection heuristic. Moreover, our study reveals a design flaw in the single-stepping countermeasure that turns the prevention mechanism against itself: An inherent side-channel within the prevention mechanism leaks the number of instructions executed by the TDX-protected VM, enabling a novel attack we refer to as StumbleStepping. Both attacks, single-stepping and StumbleStepping, work on the most recent Intel TDX enabled Xeon Scalable CPUs. Using StumbleStepping, we demonstrate a novel end-to-end attack against wolfSSL's ECDSA implementation, exploiting a control flow side-channel in its truncation-based nonce generation algorithm. We provide a systematic study of nonce-truncation implementations, revealing similar leakages in OpenSSL, which we exploit with our single-stepping primitive. Finally, we propose design changes to TDX to mitigate our attacks."

    "abstract": "Interrupts are fundamental for inter-process and cross-core communication in modern systems. Controlling these communication mechanisms historically requires switches into the kernel or hypervisor, incurring high-performance costs. To alleviate these costs, Intel introduced new hardware mechanisms to send inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) from user space without switching into the kernel and from virtual machines without switching into the hypervisor. However, it is unclear whether this direct, unsupervised interaction between unprivileged (or virtualized) workloads and the underlying hardware introduces a significant change in the attack surface.In this paper, we present the IPI side channel, a novel side-channel attack exploiting the recently introduced user interrupts and IPI virtualization features on Intel Sapphire Rapids and the upcoming Intel Arrow Lake processors. The IPI side channel is the first cross-core interrupt detection side channel, allowing an attacker to monitor interrupts delivered to any physical core of the same processor. Our attack is based on precise measurements of the hardware delivery time of interrupts from user space and virtual machines. More specifically, we exploit that interrupts are delivered through a cross-core bus, leading to timing variations on the attacker's local IPIs. We present multiple case studies to compare the IPI side channel with the state of the art: First, we present an unprivileged cross-core covert channel with a native true capacity of 434.7 kbit/s (n=100, σx=0.03) and a cross-VM capacity of 3.45 kbit/s (n=100, σx=0.01). Second, we demonstrate a native inter-keystroke timing attack with an F1 score of 97.9\\%. Third, we present an open-world website fingerprinting attack on the top 100 websites, achieving an F1 score of 89.0\\% in a native scenario and an F1 score of 71.0\\% in a cross-VM (thin client) scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the broader context of the IPI side channels and categorize interrupt side channels and mitigations."

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, microarchitectural side channels have been the focus of a large body of research on the development of new attack techniques, exploiting them to attack various classes of targets and designing mitigations. One line of work focuses on increasing the speed of the attacks, achieving higher levels of temporal resolution that can allow attackers to learn finer-grained information. The most recent addition to this line of work is Prime+Scope [CCS '21], which only requires a single access to the L1 cache to confirm the absence of victim activity in a cache set. While significantly faster than prior attacks, Prime+Scope is still an order of magnitude slower than cache access. In this work, we set out to close this gap.We draw on techniques from research into microarchitectural weird gates, software constructs that exploit transient execution to perform arbitrary computation on cache state. We design the Spec-o-Scope gate, a new weird gate that performs 10 cache probes in quick succession, which forms the basis for our eponymous attack. Our Spec-o-Scope attack achieves an order of magnitude improvement in temporal resolution compared to the previous state-of-the-art of Prime+Scope, reducing the measurement time from ~70 cycles to only 5 --- only one cycle more than an L1 cache access. We experimentally verify that our attack can detect timing differences in a 5 cycle resolution. Finally, using our Spec-o-Scope attack, we are able to show the first microarchitectural side-channel attack on an unmodified AES S-box-based implementation, which uses generic CPU features and does not require manipulation of the operating system's scheduler."

    "abstract": "Machine-learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used to distinguish malware from benign binaries. Recent work has shown that ML-based detectors can be evaded by adversarial examples, but also that one may defend against such attacks via adversarial training. However, adversarial training, and subsequent robustness evaluation, is computationally expensive in the raw-binary malware-detection domain because it requires producing many adversarial examples for both training and evaluation. Prior work found that Greedy-training, a faster robust training technique that forgoes using adversarial examples, showed some promise in producing robust malware detectors. However, Greedy-training was far less effective in inducing robustness than the more expensive adversarial training, and it also severely hurt natural accuracy (i.e., accuracy on the original data). To faster train models, this work presents GreedyBlock-training, an enhanced version of Greedy-training that we empirically show achieves not only state-of-the-art robustness in malware detectors, exceeding even adversarial training, but also retains natural accuracy better than adversarial training. Furthermore, as it does not require creating adversarial (or functional) examples, GreedyBlock-training is significantly faster than adversarial training. Specifically, we show that GreedyBlock-training can produce more robust (+54\\% on average), more naturally accurate (+7\\% on average), and more efficiently trained (-91\\% average computation) malware detectors than prior work. To faster evaluate models, we also develop methods to faster gauge the robustness of ML-based raw-binary malware detectors by introducing robustness proxies, which can be used either to predict which models are likely to be the most robust, thus helping prioritize which detectors to evaluate with expensive attacks, or aiding in deciding which detectors are worthwhile to continue training. Experimentally, we show these proxy measures can find the most robust detector in a pool of detectors while using only ~20-50\\% of the computation that would otherwise be required."

    "abstract": "APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) with the characteristics of persistence, stealth, and diversity is one of the greatest threats against cyber-infrastructure. As a countermeasure, existing studies leverage provenance graphs to capture the complex relations between system entities in a host for effective APT detection. In addition to detecting single attack events as most existing work does, understanding the tactics / techniques (e.g., Kill-Chain, ATT&amp;CK) applied to organize and accomplish the APT attack campaign is also important for security operations. Existing studies try to manually design a set of rules to map low-level system events to high-level APT tactics / techniques. However, the rule based methods are coarse-grained and lack generalization ability. Thus, they can only recognize APT tactics and have difficulty in identifying APT techniques. They also cannot adapt to mutant behaviors of existing APT tactics / techniques.In this paper, we propose TREC, the first attempt to recognize APT tactics / techniques from provenance graphs by exploiting deep learning techniques. To address the \"needle in a haystack\" problem, TREC segments small and compact subgraphs covering individual APT technique instances from a large provenance graph based on a malicious node detection model and a subgraph sampling algorithm. To address the \"training sample scarcity\" problem, TREC trains the APT tactic / technique recognition model in a few-shot learning manner by adopting a Siamese neural network. We evaluate TREC based on a customized dataset collected and made public by our team. The experiment results show that TREC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in APT tactic recognition and TREC can also effectively identify APT techniques."

    "abstract": "In AR/VR devices, the voice interface, serving as one of the primary AR/VR control mechanisms, enables users to interact naturally using speeches (voice commands) for accessing data, controlling applications, and engaging in remote communication/meetings. Voice authentication can be adopted to protect against unauthorized speech inputs. However, existing voice authentication mechanisms are usually susceptible to voice spoofing attacks and are unreliable under the variations of phonetic content. In this work, we propose SAFARI, a spoofing-resistant and text-independent speech authentication system that can be seamlessly integrated into AR/VR voice interfaces. The key idea is to elicit phonetic-invariant biometrics from the facial muscle vibrations upon the headset. During speech production, a user's facial muscles are deformed for articulating phoneme sounds. The facial deformations associated with the phonemes are referred to as visemes. They carry rich biometrics of the wearer's muscles, tissue, and bones, which can propagate through the head and vibrate the headset. SAFARI aims to derive reliable facial biometrics from the viseme-associated facial vibrations captured by the AR/VR motion sensors. Particularly, it identifies the vibration data segments that contain rich viseme patterns (prominent visemes) less susceptible to phonetic variations. Based on the prominent visemes, SAFARI learns on the correlations among facial vibrations of different frequencies to extract biometric representations invariant to the phonetic context. The key advantages of SAFARI are that it is suitable for commodity AR/VR headsets (no additional sensors) and is resistant to voice spoofing attacks as the conductive property of the facial vibrations prevents biometric disclosure via the air media or the audio channel. To mitigate the impacts of body motions in AR/VR scenarios, we also design a generative diffusion model trained to reconstruct the viseme patterns from the data distorted by motion artifacts. We conduct extensive experiments with two representative AR/VR headsets and 35 users under various usage and attack settings. We demonstrate that SAFARI can achieve over 96\\% true positive rate on verifying legitimate users while successfully rejecting different kinds of spoofing attacks with over 97\\% true negative rates."

    "abstract": "Graph-based anomaly detection is pivotal in diverse security applications, such as fraud detection in transaction networks and intrusion detection for network traffic. Standard approaches, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), often struggle to generalize across shifting data distributions. For instance, we observe that a real-world eBay transaction dataset revealed an over 50\\% decline in fraud detection accuracy when adding data from only a single new day to the graph due to data distribution shifts. This highlights a critical vulnerability in purely data-driven approaches. Meanwhile, real-world domain knowledge, such as \"simultaneous transactions in two locations are suspicious,\" is more stable and a common existing component of real-world detection strategies. To explicitly integrate such knowledge into data-driven models such as GCNs, we propose KnowGraph, which integrates domain knowledge with data-driven learning for enhanced graph-based anomaly detection. KnowGraph comprises two principal components: (1) a statistical learning component that utilizes a main model for the overarching detection task, augmented by multiple specialized knowledge models that predict domain-specific semantic entities; (2) a reasoning component that employs probabilistic graphical models to execute logical inferences based on model outputs, encoding domain knowledge through weighted first-order logic formulas. In addition, KnowGraph has leveraged the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science to estimate and mitigate prediction uncertainties. Empirically, KnowGraph has been rigorously evaluated on two significant real-world scenarios: collusion detection in the online marketplace eBay and intrusion detection within enterprise networks. Extensive experiments on these large-scale real-world datasets show that KnowGraph consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both transductive and inductive settings, achieving substantial gains in average precision when generalizing to completely unseen test graphs. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning component in improving detection performance, especially under extreme class imbalance. These results highlight the potential of integrating domain knowledge into data-driven models for high-stakes, graph-based security applications."

    "abstract": "Formal verification of hardware often requires the creation of clock-cycle accurate properties that need tedious and error-prone adaptations for each design. Property violations further require attention from verification engineers to identify affected instructions. This oftentimes manual effort hinders the adoption of formal verification at scale. This paper introduces Microarchitectural Control-Flow Integrity (μCFI), a new general security property that can capture multiple classes of vulnerabilities under different threat models, most notably the microarchitectural violation of constant-time execution and (micro-)architectural vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to hijack the (architectural) control flow. We show a novel approach for the verification of μCFI using a single property that checks for information flows from instruction operands to the program counter by injecting taint at appropriate clock cycles. To check arbitrary sequences of instructions and associate property violations to a specific Instruction Under Verification (IUV), we propose techniques for declassifying tainted data when it is being written to registers and forwarded from the IUV through architecturally known paths. We show that our verification approach is low effort (e.g., requires tagging six signals) while capturing all interactions between unbounded sequences of instructions in the extended threat model of \\o{}urname. We verify four RISC-V CPUs against μCFI and prove that μCFI is satisfied in many cases while detecting five new security vulnerabilities (4 CVEs), three of which are in Ibex, which has already been checked by state-of-the-art verification approaches."

Existing memory encryption mechanisms, such as Intel SGX integrity tree, offer neither crash consistency nor recoverability, which results in attack surfaces and causes a non-trivial limitation of practical availability. Although the crash consistency of encrypted memory has been studied in the research field of microarchitecture, existing mechanisms lack formal security analysis and cannot incorporate with metadata optimization mechanisms, which are essential to achieve a practical performance. Crystalor efficiently realizes provably-secure recoverable memory encryption with metadata optimization. To establish Crystalor with provable security and practical performance, we develop a dedicated universal hash function PXOR-Hash and a microarchitecture equipped with PXOR-Hash. Crystalor incurs almost no latency overhead under the nominal operations for the recoverability, while it has a simple construction in such a way as to be compatible with existing microarchitectures. We evaluate its practical performance through both algorithmic analyses and system-level simulation in comparison with the state-of-the-art ones, such as SCUE. Crystalor requires 29--62\\% fewer clock cycles per memory read/write operation than SCUE for protecting a 4 TB memory. In addition, Crystalor and SCUE require 312 GB and 554 GB memory overheads for metadata, respectively, which indicates that Crystalor achieves a memory overhead reduction of 44\\%. The results of the system-level simulation using the gem5 simulator indicate that Crystalor achieves a reduction of up to 11.5\\% in the workload execution time compared to SCUE. Moreover, Crystalor achieves a higher availability and memory recovery several thousand times faster than SCUE, as Crystalor offers lazy recovery."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has rapidly become a compelling paradigm that enables multiple clients to jointly train a model by sharing only gradient updates for aggregation, without revealing their local private data. In order to protect the gradient updates which could also be privacy-sensitive, there has been a line of work studying local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms to provide a formal privacy guarantee. With LDP mechanisms, clients locally perturb their gradient updates before sharing them out for aggregation. However, such approaches are known for greatly degrading the model utility, due to heavy noise addition. To enable a better privacy-utility trade-off, a recently emerging trend is to apply the shuffle model of DP in FL, which relies on an intermediate shuffling operation on the perturbed gradient updates to achieve privacy amplification. Following this trend, in this paper, we present Camel, a new communication-efficient and maliciously secure FL framework in the shuffle model of DP. Camel first departs from existing works by ambitiously supporting integrity check for the shuffle computation, achieving security against malicious adversary. Specifically, Camel builds on the trending cryptographic primitive of secret-shared shuffle, with custom techniques we develop for optimizing system-wide communication efficiency, and for lightweight integrity checks to harden the security of server-side computation. In addition, we also derive a significantly tighter bound on the privacy loss through analyzing the R\\'{e}nyi differential privacy (RDP) of the overall FL process.

However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data collection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant privacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this concern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates split learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its benefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack methods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which exploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct private scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce S^2NeRF, secure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing decaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient information, S^2NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of the NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of S^2NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its viability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications."

    "abstract": "Clustering is an important tool for data exploration where the goal is to subdivide a data set into disjoint clusters that fit well into the underlying data structure. When dealing with sensitive data, privacy-preserving algorithms aim to approximate the non-private baseline while minimising the leakage of sensitive information. State-of-the-art privacy-preserving clustering algorithms tend to output clusters that are good in terms of the standard metrics, inertia, silhouette score, and clustering accuracy, however, the clustering result strongly deviates from the non-private KMeans baseline. In this work, we present a privacy-preserving clustering algorithm called DPM that recursively separates a data set into clusters based on a geometrical clustering approach. In addition, DPM estimates most of the data-dependent hyper-parameters in a privacy-preserving way. We prove that DPM preserves Differential Privacy and analyse the utility guarantees of DPM. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation for synthetic and real-life data sets. We show that DPM achieves state-of-the-art utility on the standard clustering metrics and yields a clustering result much closer to that of the popular non-private KMeans algorithm without requiring the number of classes."

We experimentally reach the same utility while saving 50\\% in terms of epsilon for ε ≤ 0.5 on the Abalone regression dataset (dataset size ≈ 4K), saving 30\\% in terms of epsilon for ε ≤ 0.08 for the Adult classification dataset (dataset size ≈ 50K), and saving 30\\% in terms of epsilon for ε ≤ 0.03 for the Spambase classification dataset (dataset size ≈ 5K).

Existing solutions typically assume a uniform privacy budget for all records and provide one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be adequate to meet each record's privacy requirement. In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a novel framework namedrPDP-FL, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme with both uniform client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to accommodate varying privacy requirements.A critical and non-trivial problem is how to determine the ideal per-record sampling probability q given the personalized privacy budget ε. We introduce a versatile solution namedSimulation-CurveFitting, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the nonlinear correlation between q and ε and derive an elegant mathematical model to tackle the problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our solution can provide significant performance gains over the baselines that do not consider personalized privacy preservation."

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is widely employed to provide privacy protection for individuals by limiting information leakage from the aggregated data. Two well-known models of DP are the central model and the local model. The former requires a trustworthy server for data aggregation, while the latter requires individuals to add noise, significantly decreasing the utility of aggregated results. Recently, many studies have proposed to achieve DP with Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) in distributed settings, namely, the distributed model, which has utility comparable to central model while, under specific security assumptions, preventing parties from obtaining others' information. One challenge of realizing DP in distributed model is efficiently sampling noise with MPC. Although many secure sampling methods have been proposed, they have different security assumptions and isolated theoretical analyses. There is a lack of experimental evaluations to measure and compare their performances. We fill this gap by benchmarking existing sampling protocols in MPC and performing comprehensive measurements of their efficiency. First, we present a taxonomy of the underlying techniques of these sampling protocols. Second, we extend widely used distributed noise generation protocols to be resilient against Byzantine attackers. Third, we implement discrete sampling protocols and align their security settings for a fair comparison. We then conduct an extensive evaluation to study their efficiency and utility. Our experiments show that (1) malicious protocols based on a technique called bitwise sampling are more efficient than other methods, and using an oblivious data structure can reduce the circuit size in high-security regimes, (2) the cost of realizing malicious security is high, under the assumption of semi-honest, using a method named distributed noise generation is much more efficient, and (3) the utility loss caused by sampling noise in MPC is small, which to a certain extent eliminates utility concerns when using the DDP protocol in practice. We open-source our code at https://github.com/yuchengxj/Secure-sampling-benchmark."

    "abstract": "Suppose each user i holds a private value xi in some metric space (U, dist), and an untrusted data analyst wishes to compute Σi f(xi) for some function f : U -&gt; R by asking each user to send in a privatized f(xi). This is a fundamental problem in privacy-preserving population analytics, and the local model of differential privacy (LDP) is the predominant model under which the problem has been studied. However, LDP requires any two different xi, x'i to be ε-distinguishable, which can be overly strong for geometric/numerical data. On the other hand, Geo-Privacy (GP) stipulates that the level of distinguishability be proportional to dist(xi, xi'), providing an attractive alternative notion of personal data privacy in a metric space. However, existing GP mechanisms for this problem, which add a uniform noise to either xi or f(xi), are not satisfactory. In this paper, we generalize the smooth sensitivity framework from Differential Privacy to Geo-Privacy, which allows us to add noise tailored to the hardness of the given instance. We provide definitions, mechanisms, and a generic procedure for computing the smooth sensitivity under GP equipped with a general metric. Then we present three applications: one-way and two-way threshold functions, and Gaussian kernel density estimation, to demonstrate the applicability and utility of our smooth sensitivity framework."

    "abstract": "Metric differential privacy (DP) provides heterogeneous privacy guarantees based on a distance between the pair of inputs. It is a widely popular notion of privacy since it captures the natural privacy semantics for many applications (such as, for location data) and results in better utility than standard DP. However, prior work in metric DP has primarily focused on the item-level setting where every user only reports a single data item. A more realistic setting is that of user-level DP where each user contributes multiple items and privacy is then desired at the granularity of the user's entire contribution. In this paper, we initiate the study of one natural definition of metric DP at the user-level. Specifically, we use the earth-mover's distance (dEM) as our metric to obtain a notion of privacy as it captures both the magnitude and spatial aspects of changes in a user's data.We make three main technical contributions. First, we design two novel mechanisms under dEM-DP to answer linear queries and item-wise queries. Specifically, our analysis for the latter involves a generalization of the privacy amplification by shuffling result which may be of independent interest. Second, we provide a black-box reduction from the general unbounded to bounded dEM-DP (size of the dataset is fixed and public) with a novel sampling based mechanism. Third, we show that our proposed mechanisms can provably provide improved utility over user-level DP, for certain types of linear queries and frequency estimation."

    "abstract": "For Nakamoto's longest-chain consensus protocol, whose proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) variants power major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Cardano, we revisit the classic problem of the security--performance tradeoff: Given a network of nodes with finite communication- and computation-resources, against what fraction of adversary power is Nakamoto consensus (NC) secure for a given block production rate? State-of-the-art analyses of NC fail to answer this question, because their bounded-delay model does not capture the rate limits to nodes' processing of blocks, which cause congestion when blocks are released in quick succession. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security--performance tradeoff for PoW NC in a bounded-capacity model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack we call the teasing strategy, that exploits congestion, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making traditional PoS NC insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of PoS NC we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC."

    "abstract": "Order manipulation attacks such as frontrunning and sandwiching have become an increasing concern in blockchain applications such as DeFi. To protect from such attacks, several recent works have designed order policy enforcement (OPE) protocols to order transactions fairly in a data-independent fashion. However, while the manipulation attacks are motivated by monetary profits, the defenses assume honesty among a significantly large set of participants. In existing protocols, if all participants are rational, they may be incentivized to collude and circumvent the order policy without incurring any penalty.This work makes two key contributions. First, we explore whether the need for the honesty assumption is fundamental. Indeed, we show that it is impossible to design OPE protocols under some requirements when all parties are rational. Second, we explore the tradeoffs needed to circumvent the impossibility result. In the process, we propose a novel concept of rationally binding transactions that allows us to construct AnimaguSwap, the first content-oblivious Automated Market Makers (AMM) interface that is secure under rationality. We report on a prototype implementation of AnimaguSwap and performance evaluation results demonstrating its practicality."

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (e.g., the Lightning Network in Bitcoin) constitute one of the most popular scalability solutions for blockchains. Their safety relies on parties being online to detect fraud attempts on-chain and being able to timely react by publishing certain transactions on-chain. However, a cheating party may bribe miners in order to censor those transactions, resulting in loss of funds for the cheated party: these attacks are known in the literature as timelock bribing attacks. In this work, we present the first channel construction that does not require parties to be online and, at the same time, is resistant to timelock bribing attacks.We start by proving for the first time that Lightning channels are secure against timelock bribing attacks in the presence of rational channel parties under the assumption that these parties constantly monitor the mempool and never deplete the channel in one direction. The latter underscores the importance of keeping a coin reserve in each channel as implemented in the Lightning Network, albeit for different reasons. We show, however, that the security of the Lightning Network against Byzantine channel parties does not carry over to a setting in which miners are rational and accept timelock bribes.Next, we introduce CRAB, the first Lightning-compatible channel construction that provides security against Byzantine channel parties and rational miners. CRAB leverages miners' incentives to safeguard the channel, thereby also forgoing the unrealistic assumption of channel parties constantly monitoring the mempool.Finally, we show how our construction can be refined to eliminate the major assumption behind payment channels, i.e., the need for online participation. To that end, we present Sleepy CRAB the first provably secure channel construction under rational miners that enables participants to go offline indefinitely. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of Sleepy CRAB and evaluate its cost in Bitcoin, thereby demonstrating its practicality."

For example, a user receives an email notification about sending money from her bank account and is given a period of time to abort.We define the authentication problem, where a mechanism interacts with a user and an attacker. A mechanism's success depends on the scenario, namely, which credentials each principal knows. The profile of a mechanism is the set of scenarios in which it succeeds. The subset relation on profiles defines a partial order on mechanisms. We bound the profile size and discover three types of novel mechanisms that are maximally secure.We show the efficacy of our model by analyzing existing mechanisms and make concrete improvement proposals: Using sticky messages for security notifications, prioritizing credentials when accessing one's bank account, and using one of our maximal mechanisms to improve a popular cryptocurrency wallet. We demonstrate the practicality of our mechanisms by implementing the latter."

Existing attacks focus on identifying different websites, but their accuracy dramatically decreases when applied to identify fine-grained webpages, especially when distinguishing among different subpages of the same website. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) attacks face the challenges of highly similar traffic patterns and a much larger scale of webpages. Furthermore, clients often visit multiple webpages concurrently, increasing the difficulty of extracting the traffic patterns of each webpage from the obfuscated traffic. In this paper, we propose Oscar, a WPF attack based on multi-label metric learning that identifies different webpages from obfuscated traffic by transforming the feature space. Oscar can extract the subtle differences among various webpages, even those with similar traffic patterns. In particular, Oscar combines proxy-based and sample-based metric learning losses to extract webpage features from obfuscated traffic and identify multiple webpages. We prototype Oscar and evaluate its performance using traffic collected from 1,000 monitored webpages and over 9,000 unmonitored webpages in the real world.

    "abstract": "Internet censorship is pervasive, with significant effort dedicated to understanding what is censored, and where. Prior censorship measurements however have identified significant inconsistencies in their results; experiments show unexplained non-deterministic behaviors thought to be caused by censor load, end-host geographic diversity, or incomplete censorship—inconsistencies which impede reliable, repeatable and correct understanding of global censorship. In this work we investigate the extent to which Equal-cost Multi-path (ECMP) routing is the cause for these inconsistencies, developing methods to measure and compensate for them.We find ECMP routing significantly changes observed censorship across protocols, censor mechanisms, and in 17 countries. We identify that previously observed non-determinism or regional variations are attributable to measurements between fixed end-hosts taking different routes based on Flow-ID; i.e., choice of intra-subnet source IP or ephemeral source port changes observed censorship. By developing new route-stable censorship measurement methods that allow consistent measurement of DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS censorship, we find ECMP routing yields censorship changes across 42\\% of IPs and 51\\% of ASes, but that impact is not uniform. We also develop an application-level traceroute tool to construct network paths using specific censored packets, thus identifying numerous causes of differences, ranging from likely failed infrastructure, to routes to the same end-host taking geographically diverse paths which experience differences in censorship en-route. Finally, we examine our results in the context of prior global measurement studies, exploring the applicability of our findings to prior observed variations, and then demonstrating how specific experiments from two studies could be impacted by, and specific results are explainable by, ECMP routing. Our work points to methods for improving future studies, reducing inconsistencies and increasing repeatability."

To ensure availability, DNSSEC follows Postel's Law [RFC1123]: \"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.\" Hence, nameservers should send not just one matching key for a record set, but all the relevant cryptographic material, e.g., all the keys for all the ciphers that they support and all the corresponding signatures. This ensures that validation succeeds, and hence availability, even if some of the DNSSEC keys are misconfigured, incorrect or correspond to unsupported ciphers.We show that this design of DNSSEC is flawed. Exploiting vulnerable recommendations in the DNSSEC standards, we develop a new class of DNSSEC-based algorithmic complexity attacks on DNS, we dub KeyTrap attacks. All popular DNS implementations and services are vulnerable. With just a single DNS packet, the KeyTrap attacks lead to a 2.000.000x spike in CPU instruction count in vulnerable DNS resolvers, stalling some for as long as 16 hours. This devastating effect prompted major DNS vendors to refer to KeyTrap as \"the worst attack on DNS ever discovered\". Exploiting KeyTrap, an attacker could effectively disable Internet access in any system utilizing a DNSSEC-validating resolver.We disclosed KeyTrap to vendors and operators on November 2, 2023, confidentially reporting the vulnerabilities to a closed group of DNS experts, operators and developers from the industry. Since then we have been working with all major vendors to mitigate KeyTrap, repeatedly discovering and assisting in closing weaknesses in proposed patches.

Our key observation is that a great proportion of execution time (e.g., 50\\%) of web applications is spent on fetching data from two major sources: database and network; our in-depth investigation reveals that the same data is often repeatedly fetched across fuzzing trials. We thus design a new solution, FuzzCache, that stores the data into software-based caches, mitigating the need for repeated and expensive data fetches. FuzzCache exposes the cached data across fuzzing trials through inter-process shared memory segments. It also, as the first work, incorporates just-in-time compilation to avoid the performance overhead associated with interpreting PHP code in real time, thereby enhancing execution efficiency.We demonstrate that FuzzCache significantly enhances web application fuzzing performance. In our experiments, we integrated FuzzCache with both a black-box fuzzer (Black-Widow) and a grey-box fuzzer (WebFuzz). The results illustrate that FuzzCache accelerates both black-box and grey-box fuzzing, achieving a throughput increase of 3x to 4x.

This means that they may be vulnerable to the same security risks associated with web apps. In this work, we discovered a new mini-program vulnerability called MiniCPRF (Cross-Page Request Forgery in Mini-Programs). The exploit of this vulnerability is easy, and the attack consequences are severe, leading to unauthorized operations, such as free shopping, and the exposure of confidential information, such as credit card numbers. The root causes of MiniCPRF can be attributed to multiple design flaws in both mini-programs and their super apps, including the insecure routing mechanism, lack of message integrity check, and plain-text storage. To evaluate the impacts of MiniCPRF, we designed an automated analysis framework called MiniCAT. It can automatically crawl mini-programs, perform static analysis on them, and generate detection reports. In large-scale real-world evaluations with MiniCAT, we identified that 32.0\\% (13,349/41,726) of analyzable mini-programs are potentially vulnerable to MiniCPRF, including some famous ones with millions of users, such as Sohu and Wenjuanxing.

The growing intensity of web attack attempts has led to \"alert fatigue\" where enterprises are inundated by excessive alerts. Although extensive research is being conducted on automated methods for detecting web attacks, it remains an open problem to identify whether the attacks are successful. Towards this end, we present SWIDE (Successful Web Injection Detection Engine), an engine to pinpoint successful web injection attacks (e.g., PHP command injection, SQL injection). This enables enterprises to focus exclusively on those crucial threats. Our methodology builds on two insights: Firstly, while attackers tend to apply payload obfuscation techniques to evade detection, all successful web injection attacks must comply with the programming language syntax to be executable; Secondly, these attacks inevitably produce observable effects, such as returning execution result or creating backdoors for future access by the attacker. Consequently, we leverage advanced syntactic and semantic analysis to 1) detect malicious syntax features in obfuscated payloads and 2) perform semantic analysis of the payload to recover the intention of the attack. With a two-stage design, namely, attack identification and confirmation mechanisms, SWIDE can accurately identify successful attacks, even amidst intricate obfuscations. Unlike proof-of-concept studies, SWIDE has been deployed and validated in real-world environments through collaborations with a cybersecurity firm. Serving 5,045 enterprise users, our system identifies that roughly 15\\% of enterprises have suffered from successful attacks on a weekly basis - an alarmingly high rate.

    "abstract": "As the field of Web3 continues its rapid expansion, the security of Web3 authentication, often the gateway to various Web3 applications, becomes increasingly crucial. Despite its widespread use as a login method by numerous Web3 applications, the security risks of Web3 authentication have not received much attention. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities in the Web3 authentication process and proposes a new type of attack, dubbed blind message attacks. In blind message attacks, attackers trick users into blindly signing messages from target applications by exploiting users' inability to verify the source of messages, thereby achieving unauthorized access to the target application. We have developed Web3AuthChecker, a dynamic detection tool that interacts with Web3 authentication-related APIs to identify vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of real-world Web3 applications shows that a staggering 75.8\\% (22/29) of Web3 authentication deployments are at risk of blind message attacks. In response to this alarming situation, we implemented Web3AuthGuard on the open-source wallet MetaMask to alert users of potential attacks. Our evaluation results show that Web3AuthGuard can successfully raise alerts in 80\\% of the tested Web3 authentications. We have responsibly reported our findings to vulnerable websites and have been assigned two CVE IDs."

    "abstract": "Dynamic methods have shown great promise in validating vulnerabilities and generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits of Node.js applications. They typically rely on dictionaries or specifications to determine the values of request parameters and their relationships. However, they still struggle to generate complex inputs from the provided dictionaries or specifications.This work introduces a novel approach that utilizes existing test suites to automatically generate end-to-end application inputs for vulnerability validation. Our key observation is that Node.js applications often provide comprehensive test suites - in our study, the unit testing code can cover an average of 85\\% of application code - which can hardly be achieved by existing dynamic methods. We thus design a new system, JSGo, that leverages test suites to construct end-to-end test inputs. Since test suites directly invoke application code instead of issuing requests from client-accessible entry points, we cannot simply transform test suites into application inputs. We instead propose a novel trace-guided mutation mechanism based on concolic execution.Our evaluation demonstrates that JSGo could reproduce 20 out of 26 known vulnerabilities, which significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods Restler, Miner, Witcher, and Burp by 10, 12, 11, 10 more cases, respectively. We also applied JSGo to validate static analysis results in popular Node.js applications such as hexo. It successfully validated seven vulnerabilities, two of which have been patched because of our reports."

    "abstract": "React, a single-page application framework, has recently become popular among web developers due to its flexible and convenient management of web application states via a syntax extension to JavaScript, called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Despite its abundant functionalities, the security of React, especially vulnerability detection, still lags: many existing vulnerability detection works do not support JSX let alone React Data Flow introduced by React components. The only exception is CodeQL, which supports JSX syntax. However, CodeQL cannot properly track React Data Flow across different components for detecting vulnerabilities.In this paper, we design a novel framework, called ReactAppScan, which constructs a Component Graph (CoG) for tracking React Data Flow and detecting vulnerabilities following both JavaScript and React data flows. Specifically, ReactAppScan relies on abstract interpretation to build such a component graph via tracking component lifecycles and then detects vulnerabilities via finding paths between sources and sinks. Our evaluation shows that ReactAppScan detects 61 zero-day vulnerabilities in real-world React applications. We have responsibly reported all the vulnerabilities and so far six vulnerabilities have been fixed and two have been acknowledged."

    "abstract": "Black-box adversarial attacks have demonstrated strong potential to compromise machine learning models by iteratively querying the target model or leveraging transferability from a local surrogate model.Recently, such attacks can be effectively mitigated by state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, e.g., detection via the pattern of sequential queries, or injecting noise into the model. To our best knowledge, we take the first step to study a new paradigm of black-box attacks with provable guarantees -- certifiable black-box attacks that can guarantee the attack success probability (ASP) of adversarial examples before querying over the target model. This new black-box attack unveils significant vulnerabilities of machine learning models, compared to traditional empirical black-box attacks, e.g., breaking strong SOTA defenses with provable confidence, constructing a space of (infinite) adversarial examples with high ASP, and the ASP of the generated adversarial examples is theoretically guaranteed without verification/queries over the target model. Specifically, we establish a novel theoretical foundation for ensuring the ASP of the black-box attack with randomized adversarial examples (AEs). Then, we propose several novel techniques to craft the randomized AEs while reducing the perturbation size for better imperceptibility. Finally, we have comprehensively evaluated the certifiable black-box attacks on the CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, and LibriSpeech datasets, while benchmarking with 16 SOTA black-box attacks, against various SOTA defenses in the domains of computer vision and speech recognition. Both theoretical and experimental results have validated the significance of the proposed attack."

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can handle increasingly complex tasks, albeit they require rapidly expanding training datasets. Collecting data from platforms with user-generated content, such as social networks, has significantly eased the acquisition of large datasets for training DNNs. Despite these advancements, the manual labeling process remains a substantial challenge in terms of both time and cost. In response, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches have emerged, where only a small fraction of the dataset needs to be labeled, leaving the majority unlabeled. However, leveraging data from untrusted sources like social networks also creates new security risks, as potential attackers can easily inject manipulated samples. Previous research on the security of SSL primarily focused on injecting backdoors into trained models, while less attention was given to the more challenging untargeted poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce Phantom, the first untargeted poisoning attack in SSL that disrupts the training process by injecting a small number of manipulated images into the unlabeled dataset. Unlike existing attacks, our approach only requires adding few manipulated samples, such as posting images on social networks, without the need to control the victim. Phantom causes SSL algorithms to overlook the actual images' pixels and to rely only on maliciously crafted patterns that Phantom superimposed on the real images. We show Phantom's effectiveness for 6 different datasets and 3 real-world social-media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest). Already small fractions of manipulated samples (e.g., 5\\%) reduce the accuracy of the resulting model by 10\\%, with higher percentages leading to a performance comparable to a naive classifier. Our findings demonstrate the threat of poisoning user-generated content platforms, rendering them unsuitable for SSL in specific tasks."

However, most existing black-box attacks rely on queries to the target ASRs, which is impractical when queries are not permitted. In this paper, we propose ZQ-Attack, a transfer-based adversarial attack on ASR systems in the zero-query black-box setting. Through a comprehensive review and categorization of modern ASR technologies, we first meticulously select surrogate ASRs of diverse types to generate adversarial examples. Following this, ZQ-Attack initializes the adversarial perturbation with a scaled target command audio, rendering it relatively imperceptible while maintaining effectiveness. Subsequently, to achieve high transferability of adversarial perturbations, we propose a sequential ensemble optimization algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the adversarial perturbation on each surrogate model, leveraging collaborative information from other models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ZQ-Attack. In the over-the-line setting, ZQ-Attack achieves a 100\\% success rate of attack (SRoA) with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 21.91dB on 4 online speech recognition services, and attains an average SRoA of 100\\% and SNR of 19.67dB on 16 open-source ASRs.

However, potential security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough investigation. Recent research reveals that attackers can rapidly exploit the victim's vulnerabilities, generating adversarial policies that result in the failure of specific tasks. For instance, reducing the winning rate of a superhuman-level Go AI to around 20\\%. Existing studies predominantly focus on two-player competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state observation.In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY) that incorporates the concept of constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability and suggests sharing transitions among subpolicies to improve attackers' exploitative ability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce significantly different activations of the victims' policy networks. Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive recommendations for deploying MARL in competitive environments."

We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection.

    "abstract": "To protect the intellectual property of well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), black-box watermarks, which are embedded into the prediction behavior of DNN models on a set of specially-crafted samples and extracted from suspect models using only API access, have gained increasing popularity in both academy and industry. Watermark robustness is usually implemented against attackers who steal the protected model and obfuscate its parameters for watermark removal. However, current robustness evaluations are primarily performed under moderate attacks or unrealistic settings. Existing removal attacks could only crack a small subset of the mainstream black-box watermarks, and fall short in four key aspects: incomplete removal, reliance on prior knowledge of the watermark, performance degradation, and high dependency on data.In this paper, we propose a watermark-agnostic removal attack called Neural Dehydration (abbrev. Dehydra), which effectively erases all ten mainstream black-box watermarks from DNNs, with only limited or even no data dependence. In general, our attack pipeline exploits the internals of the protected model to recover and unlearn the watermark message. We further design target class detection and recovered sample splitting algorithms to reduce the utility loss and achieve data-free watermark removal on five of the watermarking schemes. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of Dehydra against ten mainstream black-box watermarks on three benchmark datasets and DNN architectures. Compared with existing removal attacks, Dehydra achieves strong removal effectiveness across all the covered watermarks, preserving at least 90\\% of the stolen model utility, under the data-limited settings, i.e., less than 2\\% of the training data or even data-free. Our work reveals the vulnerabilities of existing black-box DNN watermarks in realistic settings, highlighting the urgent need for more robust watermarking techniques.

    "abstract": "A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites. This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine. Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community. Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective. Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges.In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree. The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing. By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model. In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design. DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that prior work missed. For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results."

However, there has not been a whitebox approach that generates option combinations by capturing the inherent execution logic of the program.This paper presents Osmart, a whitebox approach designed to systematically extract program options and effective option combinations that precisely encapsulate the intrinsic execution logic of the program, incorporating both data dependency and control dependency.OSmart successfully inferred 12,560 option combinations from 56 programs.

    "abstract": "Computer programs are not executed in isolation, but rather interact with the execution environment which drives the program behaviors. Software validation methods thus need to capture the effect of possibly complex environmental interactions. Program environments may come from files, databases, configurations, network sockets, human-user interactions, and more. Conventional approaches for environment capture in symbolic execution and model checking employ environment modeling, which involves manual effort. In this paper, we take a different approach based on an extension of greybox fuzzing. Given a program, we first record all observed environmental interactions at the kernel/user-mode boundary in the form of system calls. Next, we replay the program under the original recorded interactions, but this time with selective mutations applied, in order to get the effect of different program environments---all without environment modeling. Via repeated (feedback-driven) mutations over a fuzzing campaign, we can search for program environments that induce crashing behaviors. Our EnvFuzz tool found 33 previously unknown bugs in well-known real-world protocol implementations and GUI applications. Many of these are security vulnerabilities and 16 CVEs were assigned."

Previous research primarily addressed this challenge through mutation or filtering techniques, which inefficiently treated all option combinations as having equal potential for vulnerabilities, thus wasting considerable time on non-vulnerable targets and resulting in low testing efficiency. In this paper, we utilize carefully designed prompt engineering to drive the large language model (LLM) to predict high-risk option combinations (i.e., more likely to contain vulnerabilities) and perform fuzz testing automatically without human intervention. We developed a tool called ProphetFuzz and evaluated it on a dataset comprising 52 programs collected from three related studies. The entire experiment consumed 10.44 CPU years.

    "abstract": "Network-facing applications are commonly exposed to all kinds of attacks, especially when connected to the internet. As a result, web servers like Nginx or client applications such as curl make every effort to secure and harden their code to rule out memory safety violations. One would expect this to include regular fuzz testing, as fuzzing has proven to be one of the most successful approaches to uncovering bugs in software. Yet, surprisingly little research has focused on fuzzing network applications. When studying the underlying reasons, we find that the interactive nature of communication, its statefulness, and the protection of exchanged messages (e.g., via encryption or cryptographic signatures) render typical fuzzers ineffective. Attempts to replay recorded messages or modify them on the fly only work for specific targets and often lead to early termination of communication.In this paper, we discuss these challenges in detail, highlighting how the focus of existing work on protocol state space promises little relief. We propose a fundamentally different approach that relies on fault injection rather than modifying messages. Effectively, we force one of the communication peers into a weird state where its output no longer matches the expectations of the target peer, potentially uncovering bugs. Importantly, this weird peer can still properly encrypt/sign the protocol message, overcoming a fundamental challenge of current fuzzers. In effect, we leave the communication system intact but introduce small corruptions. Since we can turn either the server or the client into the weird peer, our approach is the first that can effectively test client-side network applications. In an extensive evaluation of 16 targets, we show that our prototype Fuzztruction-Net significantly outperforms other fuzzers in terms of coverage and bugs found.

However, fuzzing large and complex programs remains challenging due to difficulties in uncovering deeply hidden vulnerabilities. This paper addresses the limitations of existing coverage-guided fuzzers, focusing on the scheduler and mutator components. Existing schedulers suffer from information sparsity and the inability to handle fine-grained feedback metrics. The mutators are agnostic of target program branches, leading to wasted computation and slower coverage exploration.To overcome these issues, we propose an end-to-end online stochastic control formulation for coverage-guided fuzzing. Our approach incorporates a novel scheduler and custom mutator that can adapt to branch logic, maximizing aggregate edge coverage achieved over multiple stages. The scheduler utilizes fine-grained branch distance measures to identify frontier branches, where new coverage is likely to be achieved. The mutator leverages branch distance information to perform efficient and targeted seed mutations, leading to robust progress with minimal overhead.We present FOX, a proof-of-concept implementation of our control-theoretic approach, and compare it to industry-standard coverage-guided fuzzers. 6 CPU-years of extensive evaluations on the FuzzBench dataset and complex real-world programs (a total of 38 test programs) demonstrate that FOX outperforms existing state-of-the-art fuzzers, achieving average coverage improvements up to 26.45\\% in real-world standalone programs and 6.59\\% in FuzzBench programs over the state-of-the-art AFL++.

We augment the classical privacy, obliviousness and authenticity notions with leakages of the garbling function, and define their leakage-resilience analogues. We examine popular garbling schemes and unveil additional side-channel weaknesses due to wire label reuse and XOR leakages. We then incorporate the idea of label refreshing into the GLNP garbling scheme of Gueron et al. and propose a variant GLNPLR that provably satisfies our leakage-resilience definitions.

    "abstract": "Secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols enable n parties, each with private inputs, to compute a given function without leaking information beyond the outputs. One of the main approaches to designing efficient MPC protocols is to use secret sharing. In general, secret sharing based MPC contains three phases: input sharing, circuit evaluation, and output recovery. If the adversary corrupts at most t parties, the protocol typically uses (t,n) threshold secret sharing to share the inputs. In this work, we consider a weaker variant of threshold secret sharing called lazy threshold secret sharing (or simply lazy sharing) and show that: Lazy sharing can serve as a viable alternative to threshold secret sharing in MPC without compromising security. Lazy sharing could be generated more efficiently than threshold secret sharing.As a result, replacing threshold secret sharing with lazy sharing can lead to a more efficient input sharing phase. Moreover, we propose that the efficiency of the circuit evaluation phase can also be further improved. To support this claim, we apply lazy sharing to several state-of-the-art MPC protocols and analyze the efficiency gain in various settings. These protocols include the GMW protocol (Goldreich et al., STOC 1987), the AFLNO protocol (Araki et al., CCS 2016), and the SPDZ protocol (Damg\\r{a}rd et al., CRYPTO 2012).

    "abstract": "Multiple works have designed or used maliciously secure honest majority MPC protocols over Z2k using replicated secret sharing (e.g. Koti et al. USENIX'21). A recent trend in the design of such MPC protocols is to first execute a semi-honest protocol, and then use a check that verifies the correctness of the computation requiring only sublinear amount of communication in terms of the circuit size. The so-called Galois ring extensions are needed in order to execute such checks over Z2k, but these rings incur incredibly high computation overheads, which completely undermine any potential benefits the ring Z2k had to begin with.In this work we revisit the task of designing sublinear distributed product checks on replicated secret-shared data over Z2k among three parties with an honest majority. We present a novel technique for verifying the correctness of a set of multiplication (in fact, inner product) triples, involving a sublinear cost in terms of the number of multiplications. Most importantly, unlike previous works, our tools do not rely on Galois ring extensions, which are computationally expensive, and only require computation over rings of the form Z2l. In terms of communication, our checks are 3 ~ 5x lighter than existing checks using ring extensions, which is already quite remarkable. However, our most noticeable improvement is in terms of computation: our checks are 17.7 ~ 44.2x better than previous approaches, for many parameter regimes of interest. Our experimental results show that checking a 10 million gate circuit with the 3PC protocol from Boyle et al. (CCS'19) takes about two minutes, while our approach takes only 2.82 seconds.Finally, our techniques are not restricted to the three-party case, and we generalize them to replicated secret-sharing with an arbitrary number of parties n. Even though the share size in this scheme grows exponentially with n, prior works have used it for n=4 or n=5 --- or even general n for feasibility results --- and our distributed checks also represent improvements in these contexts."

    "abstract": "We address the problem of detecting and punishing shareholder collusion in secret-sharing schemes. We do it in the recently proposed cryptographic model called individual cryptography (Dziembowski, Faust, and Lizurej, Crypto 2023), which assumes that there exist tasks that can be efficiently computed by a single machine but distributing this computation across multiple (mutually distrustful devices) is infeasible. Within this model, we introduce a novel primitive called secret sharing with snitching (SSS), in which each attempt to illegally reconstruct the shared secret S results in a proof that can be used to prove such misbehavior (and, e.g., financially penalize the cheater on a blockchain). This holds in a very strong sense, even if the shareholders attempt not to reconstruct the entire secret~S but only learn some partial information about it. Our notion also captures the attacks performed using multiparty computation protocols (MPCs), i.e., those where the malicious shareholders use MPCs to compute partial information on S. The main idea of SSS is that any illegal reconstruction can be proven and punished, which suffices to discourage illegal secret reconstruction. Hence, our SSS scheme effectively prevents shareholders' collusion. We provide a basic definition of threshold (t-out-of-n) SSS. We then show how to construct it for t = n, and later, we use this construction to build an SSS scheme for an arbitrary t. In order to prove the security of our construction, we introduce a generalization of the random oracle model (Bellare, Rogaway, CCS 1993), which allows modelling hash evaluations made inside MPC."

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) provides a promising solution for privacy-preserving multi-source data analytics. However, existing MPC-based collaborative analytics systems (MCASs) have unsatisfying performance for scenarios with dynamic databases. Naively running an MCAS on a dynamic database would lead to significant redundant costs and raise performance concerns, due to the substantial duplicate contents between the pre-updating and post-updating databases.In this paper, we propose Shortcut, a framework that can work with MCASs to enable efficient queries on dynamic databases that support data insertion, deletion, and update. The core idea of Shortcut is to materialize previous query results and directly update them via our query result update (QRU) protocol to obtain current query results. We customize several efficient QRU protocols for common SQL operators, including Order-by-Limit, Group-by-Aggregate, Distinct, Join, Select, and Global Aggregate. These protocols are composable to implement a wide range of query functions. In particular, we propose two constant-round protocols to support data insertion and deletion. These protocols can serve as important building blocks of other protocols and are of independent interest. They address the problem of securely inserting/deleting a row into/from an ordered table while keeping the order. Our experiments show that Shortcut outperforms naive MCASs for minor updates arriving in time, which captures the need of many realistic applications (e.g., insurance services, account data management). For example, for a single query after an insertion, Shortcut achieves up to 186.8x improvement over those naive MCASs without our QRU protocols on a dynamic database with 216 ~ 220 rows, which is common in real-life applications."

The computational and communication complexity of proving each step of a computation in Dora, is constant in the number of supported instructions. Dora's approach is united by intuitive abstraction we call a ZKBag, a cryptographic primitive constructed from linearly homomorphic commitments that captures the properties of a physical bag. We implement Dora and demonstrate that on commodity hardware it can prove the correct execution of a processor with thousands of instruction, each of which has thousands of gates, in just a few milliseconds per step."

This is in contrast to existing CP frameworks that assume compatible polynomial commitment schemes between different components of the proof systems. In addition to application to CP, we also show that our notion yields a version of Spartan with better proof size and verification complexity, at the cost of a more expensive prover.We achieve this via a combination of the following technical contributions: (i) we construct a new univariate commitment scheme in the updatable SRS setting that has better prover complexity than KZG (ii) we construct a new multilinear commitment scheme in the updatable setting that is compatible for linking with our univariate scheme (iii) we construct an argument of knowledge to prove a given linear relationship between two witnesses committed using a two-tiered commitment scheme (Pedersen+AFG) using Dory as a black-box.

    "abstract": "The Paillier cryptosystem is renowned for its applications in electronic voting, threshold ECDSA, multi-party computation, and more, largely due to its additive homomorphism. In these applications, range proofs for the Paillier cryptosystem are crucial for maintaining security, because of the mismatch between the message space in the Paillier system and the operation space in application scenarios.In this paper, we present novel range proofs for the Paillier cryptosystem, specifically aimed at optimizing those for both Paillier plaintext and affine operation. We interpret encryptions and affine operations as commitments over integers, as opposed to solely over ℤN . Consequently, we propose direct range proof for the updated cryptosystem, thereby eliminating the need for auxiliary integer commitments as required by the current state-of-the-art. Our work yields significant improvements: in the range proof for Paillier plaintext, our approach reduces communication overheads by approximately 60\\%, and computational overheads by 30\\% and 10\\% for the prover and verifier, respectively. In the range proof for Paillier affine operation, our method reduces the bandwidth by 70\\%, and computational overheads by 50\\% and 30\\% for the prover and verifier, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our techniques can be utilized to improve the performance of threshold ECDSA and the DCR-based instantiation of the Naor-Yung CCA2 paradigm."

    "abstract": "We consider how to design an anonymous data collection protocol that enforces compliance rules. Imagine that each client contributes multiple data items (e.g., votes, location crumbs, or secret shares of its input) to an abstraction of an anonymous network, which mixes all clients' data items so that the receiver cannot determine which data items belong to the same user. Now, each user must prove to an auditor that the set it contributed satisfies a compliance predicate, without identifying which items it contributed. For example, the auditor may want to ensure that no voter voted for the same candidate twice, or that a user's location crumbs are not too far apart in a given time interval.Our main contribution is a novel anonymous, compliant data collection protocol that realizes the above goal. In comparison with naive approaches such as generic multi-party computation or earlier constructions of collaborative zero-knowledge proofs, the most compelling advantage of our approach is that each client's communication and computation overhead do not grow with respect to the number of clients n. In this sense, we save a factor of at least n over prior work, which allows our technique to scale to applications with a large number of clients, such as anonymous voting and privacy-preserving federated learning.We first describe our protocol using generic cryptographic primitives that can be realized from standard assumptions. We then suggest a concrete instantiation called Conan which we implement and evaluate. In this concrete instantiation, we are willing to employ SNARKs and the random oracle model for better practical efficiency. Notably, in this practical instantiation, each client's additional communication overhead (not counting the overhead of sending its data items over the anonymous network) is only O (1). We evaluated our technique in various application settings, including secure voting, and secure aggregation protocols for histogram, summation, and vector summation. Our evaluation results show that in all scenarios, each client's additional communication overhead is only 2.2KB or 2.6KB, depending on which SNARK implementation we use. Further, each client's computation only 0.2s - 0.5s for almost all cases, except for the vector summation application where the data items are high-dimensional and each client's computation is 8.5-10.6s."

These properties make zkSNARKs a powerful tool for adding accountability, scalability, and privacy to numerous systems such as blockchains and verifiable key directories. Unfortunately, existing zkSNARKs are unable to scale to large computations due to time and space complexity requirements for the prover algorithm. As a result, they cannot handle real-world instances of the aforementioned applications.In this work, we introduce Hekaton, a zkSNARK that overcomes these barriers and can efficiently handle arbitrarily large computations. We construct Hekaton via a new ''distribute-and-aggregate'' framework that breaks up large computations into small chunks, proves these chunks in parallel in a distributed system, and then aggregates the resulting chunk proofs into a single succinct proof Underlying this framework is a new technique for efficiently handling data that is shared between chunks that we believe could be of independent interest.We implement a distributed prover for Hekaton, and evaluate its performance on a compute cluster. Our experiments show that Hekaton achieves strong horizontal scalability (proving time decreases linearly as we increase the number of nodes in the cluster), and is able to prove large computations quickly: it can prove computations of size 2^35 gates in under an hour, which is much faster than prior work.Finally, we also apply Hekaton to two applications of real-world interest: proofs of batched insertion for a verifiable key directory and proving correctness of RAM computations. In both cases, Hekaton is able to scale to handle realistic workloads with better efficiency than prior work."

Existing works on randomness beacons suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) security only against static (i.e., non-adaptive) adversaries, (ii) each epoch takes many rounds of communication, or (iii) computationally expensive tools such as proof-of-work (PoW) or verifiable delay functions (VDF). In this work, we introduce GRandLine, the first adaptively secure randomness beacon protocol that overcomes all these limitations while preserving simplicity and optimal resilience in the synchronous network setting. We achieve our result in two steps. First, we design a novel distributed key generation (DKG) protocol GRand that runs in O(λ n2 log n ) bits of communication but, unlike most conventional DKG protocols, outputs both secret and public keys as group elements. Here, λ denotes the security parameter. Second, following termination of GRand, parties can use their keys to derive a sequence of randomness beacon values, where each random value costs only a single asynchronous round and O(λ n2) bits of communication. We implement GRandLine and evaluate it using a network of up to 64 parties running in geographically distributed AWS instances. Our evaluation shows that GRandLine can produce about 2 beacon outputs per second in a network of 64 parties. We compare our protocol to the state-of-the-art randomness beacon protocols OptRand (NDSS '23), BRandPiper (CCS '21), and Drand, in the same setting and observe that it vastly outperforms them."

Yet, this swift growth brings with it substantial challenges, notably the surge in scam tokens, imposing significant security threats on cryptocurrency investments and trading. Existing detection methods of scam token, primarily relying on analyzing contract codes or transaction patterns, struggle to catch increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by scammers. For example, contract-based analysis are unable to identify scams lacking overt malicious code, e.g., most rugpulls, while transaction-based methods generally lack the foresight to early-detect potential risks.In this paper, we present TokenScout, the first temporal temporal graph neural network-based framework for scam token early detection. TokenScout formulates token transfer data as a dynamic temporal attributed multigraph and leverages the temporal graph learning model to learn graph representations. It also builds a graph representation refining model based on contrastive learning to learn a more discriminative representation space for risk identification. We evaluated TokenScout using a comprehensive dataset of 214,084 standard ERC20 tokens from 2015 to February 2023. TokenScout achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.41\\%.

During this process, transactions are efficiently processed off the main chain. Besides, both the transaction data and the zero-knowledge proofs of transaction executions are reserved on the main chain, ensuring the availability of transaction data as well as the correctness and verifiability of transaction executions. Hence, any bugs that cause the transaction finalization failure are crucial, as they impair the usability of these protocols and the scalability of blockchains.In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on finalization failure bugs in zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols, and define two kinds of such bugs. Besides, we design fAmulet, the first tool to detect finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, a prominent zero-knowledge layer 2 protocol, by leveraging fuzzing testing. To trigger finalization failure bugs effectively, we introduce a finalization behavior model to guide our transaction fuzzer to generate and mutate transactions for inducing diverse behaviors across each component (e.g., Sequencer) in the finalization process. Moreover, we define bug oracles according to the distinct bug definitions to accurately detect bugs. Through our evaluation, fAmulet can uncover twelve zero-day finalization failure bugs in Polygon zkRollup, and cover at least 20.8\\% more branches than baselines. Furthermore, through our preliminary study, fAmulet uncovers a zero-day finalization failure bug in Scroll zkRollup, highlighting the generality of fAmulet to be applied to other zero-knowledge layer 2 protocols.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of the address poisoning attack surged on the Ethereum blockchain. This phishing attack typically exploits the address shortening feature of Ethereum explorers and digital wallets (e.g., Etherscan and MetaMask) by crafting token transfer events with a seemingly correct address to poison victims' transfer history, waiting for them to mistakenly transfer assets to the attacker's address. To systematically detect and characterize the address poisoning attack, we developed a detection system named Poison-Hunter, which can recognize the attacker's crafted transfers and detect the phishing addresses controlled by the attacker. By applying Poison-Hunter to Ethereum blocks produced from Nov. 2022 to Feb. 2024, we have detected millions of phishing transfers and phishing addresses. Our analysis shows that the attacker has predominantly targeted USDC and USDT token holders and used a phishing address that looks highly similar to a benign one. We also find that the sender of legitimate transfers was the primary target of this attack. Furthermore, by tracing the transaction history of the detected phishing addresses, we reveal that over 1,800 victim addresses have lost crypto assets, with a potential financial loss of up to 144 million US dollars. Among them, about 90 million of loss are confirmed by this work. Finally, our analysis suggests that 98\\% of phishing addresses are controlled by four entities, which collected nearly 92\\% of the total profits. Overall, this paper sheds light on the tactics utilized in the address poisoning attack and its scale and impact on the Ethereum blockchain, emphasizing the urgent need for an effective detection and prevention mechanism against such a phishing activity."

    "abstract": "Blockchain adoption has surged with the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. However, the significant value of digital assets managed by DeFi protocols makes them prime targets for attacks. Current smart contract vulnerability detection tools struggle with DeFi protocols due to deep logical bugs arising from complex financial interactions between multiple smart contracts. These tools primarily analyze individual contracts and resort to brute-force methods for DeFi protocols crossing numerous smart contracts, leading to inefficiency.We introduce FORAY, a highly effective attack synthesis framework against deep logical bugs in DeFi protocols. FORAY proposes a novel attack sketch generation and completion framework. Specifically, instead of treating DeFis as regular programs, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to lift the low-level smart contracts into their high-level financial operations. Based on our DSL, we first compile a given DeFi protocol into a token flow graph, our graphical representation of DeFi protocols. Then, we design an efficient sketch generation method to synthesize attack sketches for a certain attack goal (e.g., price manipulation, arbitrage, etc.). This algorithm strategically identifies candidate sketches by finding reachable paths in Token Flow Graph (TFG), which is much more efficient than random enumeration. For each candidate sketch written in our DSL, FORAY designs a domain-specific symbolic compilation to compile it into SMT constraints. Our compilation simplifies the constraints by removing redundant smart contract semantics. It maintains the usability of symbolic compilation, yet scales to problems orders of magnitude larger. Finally, the candidates are completed via existing solvers and are transformed into concrete attacks via direct syntax transformation. Through extensive experiments on real-world security incidents, we demonstrate that FORAY significantly outperforms Halmos and ItyFuzz, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools for smart contract vulnerability detection, in both effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, out of 34 benchmark DeFi logical bugs that happened in the last two years, FORAY synthesizes 27 attacks, whereas ItyFuzz and Halmos only synthesize 11 and 3, respectively. Furthermore, FORAY also finds ten zero-day vulnerabilities in the BNB chain. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our key components and FORAY's capability of avoiding false positives."

Although there are studies that manually craft DoS attacks on specific blockchains in isolation, none of them can discover DoS weaknesses in blockchains automatically. In this paper, we provide an insight into DoS weaknesses in blockchain resource models, and present a generic and systematic approach to uncover these weaknesses. In our approach, we first identify DoS weaknesses by DoSVER, a novel tool that reasons feasible DoS weaknesses against blockchain resource models by formal verification. The identified DoS weaknesses will be further validated by DoSDET, a new framework that automates the attack synthesis in exploiting the identified DoS weaknesses.

In bribing attacks, an adversary offers participants a reward in exchange for instructing them how to behave, with the goal of attacking the protocol's properties. Specifically, our work focuses on adversaries that target blockchain safety. We consider two types of bribing, depending on how the bribes are awarded: i) guided bribing, where the bribe is given as long as the bribed party behaves as instructed; ii) effective bribing, where bribes are conditional on the attack's success, w.r.t. well-defined metrics. We analyze each type of attack in a game theoretic setting and identify relevant equilibria. In guided bribing, we show that the protocol is not an equilibrium and then describe good equilibria, where the attack is unsuccessful, and a negative one, where all parties are bribed such that the attack succeeds. In effective bribing, we show that both the protocol and the \"all bribed\" setting are equilibria. Using the identified equilibria, we then compute bounds on the Prices of Stability and Anarchy. Our results indicate that additional mitigations are needed for guided bribing, so our analysis concludes with incentive-based mitigation techniques, namely slashing and dilution. Here, we present two positive results, that both render the protocol an equilibrium and achieve maximal welfare for all parties, and a negative result, wherein an attack becomes more plausible if it severely affects the ledger's token's market price."

In recent years, a large number of abstract designs and concrete implementations of KEMs have been proposed, e.g., in the context of the NIST process for post-quantum primitives.In this work, we (i) establish stronger security notions for KEMs, and (ii) develop a symbolic analysis method to analyze security protocols that use KEMs. First, we generalize existing security notions for KEMs in the computational setting, introduce several stronger security notions and prove their relations. Our new properties formalize in which sense outputs of the KEM uniquely determine, i.e., bind, other values. Our new binding properties can be used, e.g., to prove the absence of attacks that were not captured by prior security notions. Among these, we identify a new class of attacks that we coin re-encapsulation attacks.Second, we develop a family of fine-grained symbolic models that correspond to our hierarchy of computational security notions, and are suitable for the automated analysis of KEM-based security protocols. We encode our models as a library in the framework of the Tamarin prover. Given a KEM-based protocol, our approach can automatically derive the minimal binding properties required from the KEM; or, if also given a concrete KEM, can analyze if the protocol meets its security goals. In case studies, Tamarin automatically discovers, e.g., that the key exchange protocol proposed in the original Kyber paper [12] requires stronger properties from the KEM than were proven in [12]."

These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting.

As we cannot keep reducing the size of transistors, chip vendors have started developing new microarchitectural optimizations to speed up computation. A recent study (Sanchez Vicarte et al., ISCA 2021) suggests that these optimizations might open the Pandora's box of microarchitectural attacks. However, there is little guidance on how to evaluate the security impact of future optimization proposals.To help chip vendors explore the impact of microarchitectural optimizations on cryptographic implementations, we develop (i) an expressive domain-specific language, called LmSpec, that allows them to specify the leakage model for the given optimization and (ii) a testing framework, called LmTest, to automatically detect leaks under the specified leakage model within the given implementation. Using this framework, we conduct an empirical study of 18 proposed microarchitectural optimizations on 25 implementations of eight cryptographic primitives in five popular libraries. We find that every implementation would contain secret-dependent leaks, sometimes sufficient to recover a victim's secret key, if these optimizations were realized. Ironically, some leaks are possible only because of coding idioms used to prevent leaks under the standard constant-time model."

However, in practice, speculative execution and side-channels are recognized threats to layout randomization. We show that kernel safety cannot be restored for attackers capable of using side-channels and speculative execution and introduce a new condition, that allows us to formally prove kernel safety in the Spectre era. Our research demonstrates that under this condition, the system remains safe without relying on layout randomization. We also demonstrate that our condition can be sensibly weakened, leading to enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee kernel safety for safe system calls in the Spectre era."

We propose LLMGuardrail, a novel framework that incorporates causal analysis and adversarial learning to obtain unbiased steering representations in LLMs. LLMGuardrail systematically identifies and blocks the confounding effects of biases, enabling the extraction of unbiased steering representations.

Common content moderation methods are limited by an effectiveness-and-efficiency dilemma, where simple models are fragile while sophisticated models consume excessive computational resources. In this paper, we reveal for the first time that effective and efficient content moderation can be achieved by extracting conceptual features from chat-oriented LLMs, despite their initial fine-tuning for conversation rather than content moderation. We propose a practical and unified content moderation framework for LLM services, named Legilimens, which features both effectiveness and efficiency. Our red-team model-based data augmentation enhances the robustness of Legilimens against state-of-the-art jailbreaking. Additionally, we develop a framework to theoretically analyze the cost-effectiveness of Legilimens compared to other methodsWe have conducted extensive experiments on five host LLMs, seventeen datasets, and nine jailbreaking methods to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of Legilimens against normal and adaptive adversaries. A comparison of Legilimens with both commercial and academic baselines demonstrates the superior performance of Legilimens. Furthermore, we confirm that Legilimens can be applied to few-shot scenarios and extended to multi-label classification tasks."

In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations.

In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90\\% and averaging above 35\\% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2\\%. By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24."

    "abstract": "Recent works show that text-to-image generative models are surprisingly vulnerable to a variety of poisoning attacks. Empirical results find that these models can be corrupted by altering associations between individual text prompts and associated visual features. Furthermore, a number of concurrent poisoning attacks can induce \"model implosion,\" where the model becomes unable to produce meaningful images for unpoisoned prompts. These intriguing findings highlight the absence of an intuitive framework to understand poisoning attacks on these models.In this work, we establish the first analytical framework on robustness of image generative models to poisoning attacks, by modeling and analyzing the behavior of the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models. We model cross-attention training as an abstract problem of \"supervised graph alignment\" and formally quantify the impact of training data by the hardness of alignment, measured by an Alignment Difficulty (AD) metric. The higher the AD, the harder the alignment. We prove that AD increases with the number of individual prompts (or concepts) poisoned. As AD grows, the alignment task becomes increasingly difficult, yielding highly distorted outcomes that frequently map meaningful text prompts to undefined or meaningless visual representations. As a result, the generative model implodes and outputs random, incoherent images at large. We validate our analytical framework through extensive experiments, and we confirm and explain the unexpected (and unexplained) effect of model implosion while producing new, unforeseen insights. Our work provides a useful tool for studying poisoning attacks against diffusion models and their defenses."

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of machine learning models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) has garnered considerable attention in recent years. These attacks determine whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Recent research has focused on reference-based attacks, which leverage difficulty calibration with independently trained reference models. While empirical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness, there is a notable gap in our understanding of the circumstances under which it succeeds or fails. In this paper, we take a further step towards a deeper understanding of the role of difficulty calibration. Our observations reveal inherent limitations in calibration methods, leading to the misclassification of non-members and suboptimal performance, particularly on high-loss samples. We further identify that these errors stem from an imperfect sampling of the potential distribution and a strong dependence of membership scores on the model parameters. By shedding light on these issues, we propose RAPID: a query-efficient and computation-efficient MIA that directly Re-leverAges the original membershiP scores to mItigate the errors in Difficulty calibration. Our experimental results, spanning 9 datasets and 5 model architectures, demonstrate that RAPID outperforms previous state-of-the-art attacks (e.g., LiRA and Canary offline) across different metrics while remaining computationally efficient. Our observations and analysis challenge the current de facto paradigm of difficulty calibration in high-precision inference, encouraging greater attention to the persistent risks posed by MIAs in more practical scenarios."

In this paper, we aim to perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses with the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePKU/PartCrop."

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated great success in various fundamental CV tasks, mainly benefiting from their self-attention-based transformer architectures, and the paradigm of pre-training followed by fine-tuning. However, such advantages may lead to significant data privacy risks, such as membership inference attacks (MIAs), which remain unclear. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on MIAs and corresponding defenses against ViTs. Our first contribution is a rollout-attention-based MIA method (RAMIA), based on an experimental observation that the attention, more precisely the rollout attention, behaves disproportionately for members and non-members. We evaluate RAMIA on the standard ViT architecture proposed by Google (ICLR 2021), achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall performance. Further, inspired by another experimental observation on a strong connection between positional embeddings (PEs) and attentions, we propose a novel framework for training ViTs, named Mosaic MixUp Training (MMUT), as a defense against RAMIA. Intuitively, MMUT mixes up private images and public ones at a patch level, and mosaics the corresponding PEs with a global learnable mosaic embedding. Our empirical results show MMUT achieves a much better accuracy-privacy trade-off than some common defense mechanisms. Extensive experiments are conducted to rigorously evaluate both RAMIA and MMUT."

Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, our analysis validates that existing fine-tuning APIs provided by OpenAI and Azure AI Studio are susceptible to our Janus attack, allowing an adversary to conduct such an attack at a low cost."

Current kernel fuzzing tools based on code coverage can detect common memory errors, but none of them is aware of the root cause.

CountDown collects diverse refcount operations from kernel executions and reshapes syscall relations based on commonly accessed refcounts. When generating user-space programs, CountDown prefers to combine syscalls that ever access the same refcounts, aiming to trigger complex refcount behaviors. It also injects refcount-decreasing and refcount-accessing syscalls to intentionally free the refcounted object and trigger invalid accesses through dangling pointers. We test CountDown on mainstream Linux kernels and compare it with popular fuzzers. On average, our tool can detect 66.1\\% more UAF bugs and 32.9\\% more KASAN reports than state-of-the-art tools.

Instead, we propose an approach that accurately identifies objects that are inexpensive to protect, and design a method to protect such objects comprehensively from all classes of memory errors. Towards this goal, we introduce the Uriah system that (1) statically identifies the heap objects whose accesses satisfy spatial and type safety, and (2) dynamically allocates such \"safe\" heap objects on an isolated safe heap to enforce a form of temporal safety while preserving spatial and type safety, called temporal allocated-type safety. Uriah finds 72.0\\% of heap allocation sites produce objects whose accesses always satisfy spatial and type safety in the SPEC CPU2006/2017 benchmarks, 5 server programs, and Firefox, which are then isolated on a safe heap using Uriah allocator to enforce temporal allocated-type safety.

However, the stark reality is that real-world implementations of ASLR are imperfect and subject to weaknesses that attackers can exploit. This work evaluates the effectiveness of ASLR on major desktop platforms, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows, by examining the variability in the placement of memory objects across various processes, threads, and system restarts. In particular, we collect samples of memory object locations, conduct statistical analyses to measure the randomness of these placements and examine the memory layout to find any patterns among objects that could decrease this randomness. The results show that while some systems, like Linux distributions, provide robust randomization, others, like Windows and MacOS, often fail to adequately randomize key areas like executable code and libraries. Moreover, we find a significant entropy reduction in the entropy of libraries after the Linux 5.18 version and identify correlation paths that an attacker could leverage to reduce exploitation complexity significantly. Ultimately, we rank the identified weaknesses based on severity and validate our entropy estimates with a proof-of-concept attack. In brief, this paper provides the first comprehensive evaluation of ASLR effectiveness across different operating systems and highlights opportunities for Operating System (OS) vendors to strengthen ASLR implementations."

While many solutions have been proposed, balancing security, run-time cost, and memory overhead (an impossible trinity) is hard.In this paper, we show one way to balance the trinity by passing more semantics about the heap object to the allocator for it to make informed allocation decisions. More specifically, we propose a new notion of thread-, context-, and flow-sensitive 'type', SemaType, to capture the semantics and prototype a SemaType-based allocator that aims for the best trade-off amongst the impossible trinity. In SeMalloc, only heap objects allocated from the same call site and via the same function call stack can possibly share a virtual memory address, which effectively stops type-confusion attacks and makes UAF vulnerabilities harder to exploit. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that SeMalloc is realistic: (a) SeMalloc is effective in thwarting all real-world vulnerabilities we tested; (b) benchmark programs run even slightly faster with SeMalloc than the default heap allocator, at a memory overhead averaged from 41\\% to 84\\%; and (c) SeMalloc balances security and overhead strictly better than other closely related works."

However, there exists a misalignment in the threat model and trusted computing base (TCB) between Kata Containers and confidential computing. The shifted trust boundaries could potentially expose a range of vulnerabilities, particularly in scenarios where a malicious actor on the host gains access to the CoCo's unprotected control interface. This paper conducts a thorough examination of CoCo's system architecture, exploring the attack surface resulting from the discord in trust boundaries. We have assessed all API endpoints of CoCo's control interface, categorizing them based on their security properties. Drawing from these insights, we have developed a bifurcation approach to splitting CoCo's control interface. This involves establishing an owner-side controller and minimizing the capabilities of the existing host-side controller. Under this framework, the host-side controller is exclusively responsible for allocating and recycling compute resources, while dedicated workload owners can directly manage their containers through alternative secure tunnels. This approach ensures seamless integration with cloud-native orchestration layers and aligns CoCo with the threat model of confidential computing. By doing so, it effectively prevents untrusted hosts from accessing confidential data and interfering with the execution of workloads within protected domains."

Despite the inspiring progress, existing schemes in this new paradigm are still faced with various challenges and bottlenecks, including large client storage, high communication, poor practical efficiency, need for non-colluding servers, or restricted client query sequences. We present simple and practical amortized sublinear stateful private information retrieval schemes without these drawbacks using new techniques in hint construction and usage. In particular, we introduce a dummy set to the client's request to eliminate any leakage or correctness failures. Our techniques can work with two non-colluding servers or a single server. The resulting PIR schemes achieve practical efficiency. The online response overhead is only twice that of simply fetching the desired entry without privacy. For a database with 2^28 entries of 32-byte, each query of our two-server scheme consumes 34 KB of communication and 2.7 milliseconds of computation, and each query of our single-server scheme consumes amortized 47 KB of communication and 4.5 milliseconds of computation. These results are one or more orders of magnitude better than prior works."

    "abstract": "Private set union (PSU) is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to compute the union of their sets without revealing anything else. Despite some efficient PSU protocols that have been proposed, they mainly focus on the balanced setting, where the sets held by the parties are of similar size. Recently, Tu et al. (CCS 2023) proposed the first unbalanced PSU protocol which achieves sublinear communication complexity in the size of the larger set. In this paper, we are interested in improving the efficiency of the unbalanced PSU protocol. We find that oblivious key-value store (OKVS) data structure plays an essential role in the most recently proposed PSU constructions and formalize unbalanced PSU as an OKVS decoding process with sublinear communication. Our key insight lies in when OKVS satisfies sparsity property, obtaining the necessary decoding information precisely aligns with the batch private information retrieval (BatchPIR) problem. We give two concrete constructions of unbalanced PSU protocols based on different OKVS encoding strategies. The first is based on oblivious PRF (OPRF) and a newly introduced cryptographic protocol called permuted private equality test, while the second is based on re-randomizable public key encryption. Both our two constructions achieve sublinear communication complexity in the size of the larger set. We implement our two unbalanced PSU protocols and compare them with the state-of-the-art unbalanced PSU of Tu et al. Experiments show that our protocols achieve a 1.3-5.6times speedup in running time and 2.1-11.8\\texttimes{} shrinking in communication cost, depending on set sizes and network environments."

    "abstract": "Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a two player protocol where the client, given some query x ε [N], interacts with the server, which holds a N-bit string DB, in order to privately retrieve DB[x]. In this work, we focus on the single-server client-preprocessing model, initially proposed by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2020), where the client and server first run a joint preprocessing algorithm, after which the client can retrieve elements from DB privately in time sublinear in N. Most known constructions of single-server client-preprocessing PIR follow one of two paradigms: They feature either (1) a linear-bandwidth offline phase where the client downloads the whole database from the server, or (2) a sublinear-bandwidth offline phase where however the server has to compute a large-depth (Ωλ(N)) circuit under fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) in order to execute the preprocessing phase.In this paper, we propose ThorPIR, a single-server client preprocessing PIR scheme which achieves both sublinear offline bandwidth (asymptotically and concretely) and a low-depth, highly parallelizable preprocessing circuit. Our main insight is to use and significantly optimize the concrete circuit-depth of a much more efficient shuffling technique needed during preprocessing, called Thorp shuffle. A Thorp shuffle satisfies a weaker security property (e.g., compared to an AES permutation) which is ''just enough'' for our construction. We estimate that with a powerful server (e.g., hundreds of thousands of GPUs), ThorPIR's end-to-end preprocessing time is faster than any prior work. Additionally, compared to prior FHE-based works with sublinear bandwidth, our construction is at least around 10,000 times faster."

To retrieve a single record from a database with over a million 256-byte records, the Respire protocol requires just 6.1 KB of online communication; this is a 5.9x reduction compared to the best previous lattice-based scheme. Moreover, Respire naturally extends to support batch queries. Compared to previous communication-efficient batch PIR schemes, Respire achieves a 3.4-7.1x reduction in total communication while maintaining comparable throughput (200-400 MB/s). The design of Respire relies on new query compression and response packing techniques based on ring switching in homomorphic encryption."

    "abstract": "Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything else. In some applications of PSI, a server holds a large set and runs a PSI protocol with multiple clients, each with its own smaller set. In this setting, existing protocols fall short: they either achieve only semi-honest security, or else require the server to run the protocol from scratch for each execution.We design an efficient protocol for this setting with simulation-based security against malicious adversaries. In our protocol, the server publishes a one-time, linear-size encoding of its set. Then, multiple clients can independently execute a PSI protocol with the server, with complexity linear in the size of each client's set. To learn the intersection, a client can download the server's encoding, which can be accelerated via content-distribution or peer-to-peer networks since the same encoding is used by all clients; alternatively, clients can fetch only the relevant parts of the encoding using verifiable private information retrieval. A key ingredient of our protocol is an efficient instantiation of an oblivious verifiable unpredictable function, which may be of independent interest.Our implementation shows that our protocol is highly efficient. For a server holding 108 elements and each client holding 103 elements, the size of the server's encoding is 800MB; an execution of the protocol uses 60MB of communication, runs in under 5s in a WAN network with 120 Mbps bandwidth, and costs only 0.017 USD when utilizing network-caching infrastructures, a 5\\texttimes{} saving compared to a state-of-the-art PSI protocol."

    "publication": "ACM CCS",
    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3690240",
    "abstract": "In scenarios where a seller holds sensitive data x, like employee / patient records or ecological data, and a buyer seeks to obtain an evaluation of specific function f on this data, solutions in trustless digital environments like blockchain-based Web3 systems typically fall into two categories: (1) Smart contract-powered solutions and (2) cryptographic solutions leveraging tools such as adaptor signatures. The former approach offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns the function evaluation f(x) (and not x entirely) upon payment. However, this approach is often inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller's data, and is incompatible with systems that do not support smart contracts with required functionalities. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an \"all-or-nothing\" guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts x and does not support functional extraction of the sensitive data. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales of information while offering improved efficiency, privacy, and compatibility similar to adaptor signatures.Towards this, we propose functional adaptor signatures (FAS) a novel cryptographic primitive that achieves all the desired properties as listed above. Using FAS, the seller can publish an advertisement committing to x. The buyer can pre-sign the payment transaction w.r.t. a function f, and send it along with the transaction to the seller. The seller adapts the pre-signature into a valid (buyer's) signature and posts the payment and the adapted signature on the blockchain to get paid. Finally, using the pre-signature and the posted signature, the buyer efficiently extracts f(x), and completes the sale. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called witness privacy to capture seller's privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond f(x). We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, witness hiding, witness indistinguishability, and zero-knowledge, to capture varying levels of leakage about x beyond f(x) to a malicious buyer.We introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions (like statistics/aggregates, kernels in machine learning, etc.), that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. One construction is based on prime-order groups and compatible with Schnorr signatures for payments, and the other is based on lattices and compatible with a variant of Lyubashevsky's signature scheme. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption, a well-explored concept over the past decade, and adaptor signatures, a relatively new primitive in the cryptographic landscape. On a technical level, we avoid heavy cryptographic machinery and achieve improved efficiency, by making black-box use of building blocks like inner product functional encryption (IPFE) while relying on certain security-enhancing techniques for the IPFE in a non-black-box manner. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, the different operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware."

To realize this new primitive we formalize the notion of blind multi-signatures (BMS), which allow a user to interact with multiple signers to obtain a (compact) signature; even if all the signers collude they are unable to link a signature to an interaction with any of them. We then present two BMS constructions, one based on BLS signatures and a second based on discrete logarithms without pairings.

    "abstract": "The transition to post-quantum cryptography has been an enormous challenge and effort for cryptographers over the last decade, with impressive results such as the future NIST standards. However, the latter has so far only considered central cryptographic mechanisms (signatures or KEM) and not more advanced ones, e.g., targeting privacy-preserving applications. Of particular interest is the family of solutions called blind signatures, group signatures and anonymous credentials, for which standards already exist, and which are deployed in billions of devices. Such a family does not have, at this stage, an efficient post-quantum counterpart although very recent works improved this state of affairs by offering two different alternatives: either one gets a system with rather large elements but a security proved under standard assumptions or one gets a more efficient system at the cost of ad-hoc interactive assumptions or weaker security models. Moreover, all these works have only considered size complexity without implementing the quite complex building blocks their systems are composed of. In other words, the practicality of such systems is still very hard to assess, which is a problem if one envisions a post-quantum transition for the corresponding systems/standards.In this work, we propose a construction of so-called signature with efficient protocols (SEP), which is the core of such privacy-preserving solutions. By revisiting the approach by Jeudy et al. (Crypto 2023) we manage to get the best of the two alternatives mentioned above, namely short sizes with no compromise on security. To demonstrate this, we plug our SEP in an anonymous credential system, achieving credentials of less than 80 KB. In parallel, we fully implemented our system, and in particular the complex zero-knowledge framework of Lyubashevsky et al. (Crypto'22), which has, to our knowledge, not be done so far. Our work thus not only improves the state-of-the-art on privacy-preserving solutions, but also significantly improves the understanding of efficiency and implications for deployment in real-world systems."

    "abstract": "We propose Reckle trees, a new vector commitment based on succinct RECursive arguments and MerKLE trees. Reckle trees' distinguishing feature is their support for succinct batch proofs that are updatable - enabling new applications in the blockchain setting where a proof needs to be computed and efficiently maintained over a moving stream of blocks. Our technical approach is based on embedding the computation of the batch hash inside the recursive Merkle verification via a hash-based accumulator called canonical hashing. Due to this embedding, our batch proofs can be updated in logarithmic time, whenever a Merkle leaf (belonging to the batch or not) changes, by maintaining a data structure that stores previously-computed recursive proofs. Assuming enough parallelism, our batch proofs are also computable in O(log n) parallel time - independent of the size of the batch. As a natural extension of Reckle trees, we also introduce Reckle+ trees. Reckle+ trees provide updatable and succinct proofs for certain types of Map/Reduce computations. In this setting, a prover can commit to a memory M and produce a succinct proof for a Map/Reduce computation over a subset I of M. The proof can be efficiently updated whenever I or M changes.We present and experimentally evaluate two applications of Reckle+ trees, dynamic digest translation and updatable BLS aggregation. In dynamic digest translation we are maintaining a proof of equivalence between Merkle digests computed with different hash functions, e.g., one with a SNARK-friendly Poseidon and the other with a SNARK-unfriendly Keccak. In updatable BLS aggregation we maintain a proof for the correct aggregation of a t-aggregate BLS key, derived from a t-subset of a Merkle-committed set of individual BLS keys. Our evaluation using Plonky2 shows that Reckle trees and Reckle+ trees have small memory footprint, significantly outperform previous approaches in terms of updates (10\\texttimes{} to 15\\texttimes{}) and verification (4.78\\texttimes{} to 1485\\texttimes{}) time, enable applications that were not possible before due to huge costs involved (Reckle trees are up to 200\\texttimes{} faster), and have similar aggregation performance with previous implementations of batch proofs."

However, there are no rigorous security specifications for realistic PKI schemes, and therefore, no PKI schemes were proven secure. Cryptographic systems that use PKI are analyzed by adopting overly simplified models of PKI, often simply assuming securely-distributed public keys. This is problematic given the extensive reliance on PKI, the multiple failures of PKI systems, and the complexity of both proposed and deployed systems, which involve complex requirements and models.We present game-based security specifications for PKI schemes and analyze important and widely deployed PKIs: PKIX and two variants of Certificate Transparency (CT). These PKIs are based on the X.509v3 standard and its CRL revocation mechanism. Our analysis identified a few subtle vulnerabilities and provides reduction-based proofs showing that the PKIs ensure specific requirements under specific models (assumptions). To our knowledge, this is the first reduction-based proof of security for a realistic PKI scheme, e.g., supporting certificate chains."

    "abstract": "We present a new construction of two-party, threshold ECDSA, building on a 2017 scheme of Lindell and improving his scheme in several ways.ECDSA signing is notoriously hard to distribute securely, due to non-linearities in the signing function. Lindell's scheme uses Paillier encryption to encrypt one party's key share and handle these non-linearities homomorphically, while elegantly avoiding any expensive zero knowledge proofs over the Paillier group during the signing process. However, the scheme pushes that complexity into key generation. Moreover, avoiding ZK proofs about Paillier ciphertexts during signing comes with a steep price -- namely, the scheme requires a \"global abort\" when a malformed ciphertext is detected, after which an entirely new key must be generated.We overcome all of these issues with a proactive Refresh procedure. Since the Paillier decryption key is part of the secret that must be proactively refreshed, our first improvement is to radically accelerate key generation by replacing one of Lindell's ZK proofs -- which requires 80 Paillier ciphertexts for statistical security 2-40 -- with a much faster \"weak\" proof that requires only 2 Paillier ciphertexts, and which proves a weaker statement about a Paillier ciphertext that we show is sufficient in the context of our scheme. Secondly, our more efficient key generation procedure also makes frequent proactive Refreshes practical. Finally, we show that adding noise to one party's key share suffices to avoid the need to reset the public verification key when certain bad behavior is detected. Instead, we prove that our Refresh procedure, performed after each detection, suffices for addressing the attack, allowing the system to continue functioning without disruption to applications that rely on the verification key.Our scheme is also very efficient, competitive with the best constructions that do not provide proactive security, and state-of-the-art among the few results that do. Our optimizations to ECDSA key generation speed up runtime and improve bandwidth over Lindell's key generation by factors of 7 and 13, respectively. Our Key Generation protocol requires 20\\% less bandwidth than existing constructions, completes in only 3 protocol messages, and executes much faster than all but OT-based key generation. For ECDSA signing, our extra Refresh protocol does add a 10X latency and 5X bandwidth overhead compared to Lindell. However, this still fits in 150 ms runtime and about 5.4 KB of messages when run in our AWS cluster benchmark."

This is typically done by app developers via providing runtime privacy notices (RPNs for short). However, given the heterogeneous privacy data types and data access patterns in modern apps, it is not clear to what extent apps (app developers) effectively fulfill this compliance requirement in practice.In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of current RPN practices in mobile apps. Our research endeavors to comprehend (1) the ecosystem of RPN, (2) potential gaps between legal requirements and RPN practices, and (3) the underlying reasons for such gaps. To achieve this, we design an automated pipeline - RENO that can effectively identify, extract, and analyze RPN at a large scale. With the help of RENO, we investigated 4,656 mobile apps selected from 19 European Union countries. Our analysis reveals a number of interesting findings. For example, 77.10\\% of user data collection behaviors lack RPNs. Among those provided RPNs, 86.35\\% of them have no more than three required notice elements when GDPR requires seven. In addition, to further understand the reasons behind such gaps, we perform a notification campaign and ask for feedback from the app developers. Indeed, the collected responses highlighted several critical reasons. For instance, a substantial proportion of app developers regard RPN as an optional complement to their privacy policies as RPNs are not strictly enforced by app stores. Our study shows the pressing need for better transparency in user data collection delivered by RPN."

    "abstract": "Generative models trained with Differential Privacy (DP) can produce synthetic data while reducing privacy risks. However, navigating their privacy-utility tradeoffs makes finding the best models for specific settings/tasks challenging. This paper bridges this gap by profiling how DP generative models for tabular data distribute privacy budgets across rows and columns, which is one of the primary sources of utility degradation. We compare graphical and deep generative models, focusing on the key factors contributing to how privacy budgets are spent, i.e., underlying modeling techniques, DP mechanisms, and data dimensionality.Through our measurement study, we shed light on the characteristics that make different models suitable for various settings and tasks. For instance, we find that graphical models distribute privacy budgets horizontally and thus cannot handle relatively wide datasets for a fixed training time; also, the performance on the task they were optimized for monotonically increases with more data but could also overfit. Deep generative models spend their budgets per iteration, so their behavior is less predictable with varying dataset dimensions, but are more flexible as they could perform better if trained on more features. Moreover, low levels of privacy (ε≥100) could help some models generalize, achieving better results than without applying DP. We believe our work will aid the deployment of DP synthetic data techniques by navigating through the best candidate models vis-\\`{a}-vis the dataset features, desired privacy levels, and downstream tasks."

However, such open API also raises security and privacy concerns associated with APIs hosted on the platform. In this work, we perform the first large-scale analysis of 32,089 APIs on the RapidAPI platform.

However, in this research, we challenge this perception and analyze the security of FIDO2 hardware security keys, which are increasingly used in 2FA and passwordless systems. Specifically, we develop an attack framework, analyze the underlying protocols of FIDO2, and examine the associated OS-level security. Through practical demonstrations, we illustrate how adversaries can exploit this framework and OS-level security measures to execute our designed attack, known as FIDOLA (&lt;u&gt;FI&lt;/u&gt;DO2 &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;eception Attack via &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;verlays exploiting &lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;imited Display &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;uthenticators).Our attack framework injects hidden login sessions, either into the same service the user intends to authenticate with or into a different service. It deceives users into approving the attackers request using the limited display of authenticators. This cross-service attack raises concerns about compromising more sensitive accounts (e.g., financial) when users log into less sensitive ones. Our attack poses a practical and fundamental threat not addressed in the FIDO specification or prior research. Unlike prior research, our demonstration exposes FIDO2 authenticator vulnerabilities in real-world 2FA and passwordless setups, where OS-level security mitigates traditional concurrent attacks (simultaneous authentication attempts by the attacker). To assess our attacks effectiveness, we conducted a user study, revealing that users approved approximately 95.55\\% of cross-service attacks when presented with a screen overlay."

Handling such sensitive data (i.e., keystrokes) in transit demands security in transit. In this work, we perform a comprehensive security measurement of the Chinese IME keyboard ecosystem, investigating the network security of keystrokes sent in transit by popular Chinese IME keyboards from nine vendors. We studied the three most popular third-party keyboards, comprising 95.9\\% of the third-party keyboard market share in China, as well as the default Chinese IME keyboards pre-installed on six popular Android mobile device manufacturers in China. We found that the vast majority of IME keyboards utilize proprietary, non-TLS network encryption protocols. Our measurement revealed critical vulnerabilities in these encryption protocols from eight out of the nine vendors in which network attackers could completely reveal the contents of users' keystrokes in transit. We estimate that up to one billion users were affected by these vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide recommendations to various stakeholders to limit the harm from this existing set of vulnerabilities, as well as to prevent future vulnerabilities of this kind."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in transforming software development, with a growing interest in integrating them into more intelligent apps. Frameworks like LangChain aid LLM-integrated app development, offering code execution utility/APIs for custom actions. However, these capabilities theoretically introduce Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, enabling remote code execution through prompt injections. No prior research systematically investigates these frameworks' RCE vulnerabilities or their impact on applications and exploitation consequences. Therefore, there is a huge research gap in this field.In this study, we propose LLMSmith to detect, validate and exploit the RCE vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated frameworks and apps. To achieve this goal, we develop two novel techniques, including 1) a lightweight static analysis to construct call chains to identify RCE vulnerabilities in frameworks; 2) a systematical prompt-based exploitation method to verify and exploit the found vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated apps. This technique involves various strategies to control LLM outputs, trigger RCE vulnerabilities and launch subsequent attacks. Our research has uncovered a total of 20 vulnerabilities in 11 LLM-integrated frameworks, comprising 19 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. Of these, 17 have been confirmed by the framework developers, with 13 vulnerabilities being assigned CVE IDs, 6 of which have a CVSS score of 9.8, and we were also awarded a bug bounty of 1350. For the 51 apps potentially affected by RCE, we successfully executed attacks on 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities and construct practical attacks to demonstrate the hazards in reality, e.g., app output hijacking, user data leakage, even the potential to take full control of systems. Last, we propose several mitigation measures for both framework and app developers to counteract such attacks."

However, this advancement has paradoxically given birth to a new, potentially more insidious cyber threat, GAZEploit. In this paper, we unveil GAZEploit, a novel eye-tracking based attack specifically designed to exploit these eye-tracking information by leveraging the common use of virtual appearances in VR applications. This widespread usage significantly enhances the practicality and feasibility of our attack compared to existing methods. GAZEploit takes advantage of this vulnerability to remotely extract gaze estimations and steal sensitive keystroke information across various typing scenarios-including messages, passwords, URLs, emails, and passcodes. Our research, involving 30 participants, achieved over 80\\% accuracy in keystroke inference. Alarmingly, our study also identified over 15 top-rated apps in the Apple Store as vulnerable to the GAZEploit attack, emphasizing the urgent need for bolstered security measures for this state-of-the-art VR/MR text entry method."

Existing law and privacy regulations emphasize that VR developers should inform users of what data are collected/used/shared (CUS) through privacy policies. However, privacy policies in the VR ecosystem are still in their early stages, and many developers fail to write appropriate privacy policies that comply with regulations and meet user expectations. In this paper, we propose VPVet to automatically vet privacy policy compliance issues for VR apps. VPVet first analyzes the availability and completeness of a VR privacy policy and then refines its analysis based on three key criteria: granularity, minimization, and consistency of CUS statements. Our study establishes the first and currently largest VR privacy policy dataset named VRPP, consisting of privacy policies of 11,923 different VR apps from 10 mainstream platforms. Our vetting results reveal severe privacy issues within the VR ecosystem, including the limited availability and poor quality of privacy policies, along with their coarse granularity, lack of adaptation to VR traits and the inconsistency between CUS statements in privacy policies and their actual behaviors. We open-source VPVet system along with our findings at repository https://github.com/kalamoo/PPAudit, aiming to raise awareness within the VR community and pave the way for further research in this field."

The global smart building market is on the rise, underscoring the importance of securing BAS networks. This paper introduces the Building Automation System Evaluator (BASE), a specialized fuzzer designed to assess the security of BAS networks. BAS networks typically involve a BAS client communicating with a BAS server through BAS protocols (e.g., BACnet, KNX), each presenting unique challenges in BAS network fuzzing. These challenges encompass complex packet structures and sequencing in BAS protocols, closed-source clients with indeterminable code coverage, and unobservable server status with limited throughput. BASE automatically identifies protocol structures, dynamically instruments clients for code coverage analysis, and monitors responses for new coverage areas. Collected timestamps are used to estimate the input scan intervals of servers, optimizing throughput. We evaluated BASE on various BAS servers and clients, uncovering 13 new vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we present three attack case studies, highlighting the real-world security implications of these vulnerabilities in BAS systems, such as delayed fire detection, loss of climate control, and security breaches. We reported our findings to the respective vendors, who acknowledged the implications, and some have subsequently patched their systems based on our reports."

    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3690370",
    "abstract": "Considering the threat from on-board eavesdropping with smartphone motion sensors, Android 12 has limited the maximum sampling rate of motion sensors to 200Hz for zero-privilege access to prevent potential wiretapping. Unfortunately, there have been some attacks targeting 200Hz, making it not a safe sampling rate any more. Smartphone manufacturers may further reduce the maximum sampling rate of the accelerometer in response to this privacy concern. It can be expected that, the maximum sampling rate will gradually decrease to a very low level, as the battle between manufacturers and adversaries continues. Existing on-board eavesdropping approaches, utilizing spectral features, cannot provide acceptable accuracy at very low sampling rates, not even at 50Hz.Therefore, this paper explores the feasibility of using the on-board accelerometer for privacy breaking with an extremely-low sampling rate, specifically, 5Hz. 5Hz is a minimum sampling rate to meet normal use, otherwise the applications can only choose to work without the accelerometer. Since the lowest fundamental frequency for humans is around 85Hz, such a low sampling rate poses a significant challenge for sound recognition. According to Nyquist's law, it seems impossible to capture 85Hz with the sampling rate of 5Hz. Fortunately, we observe that the rhythm features, including pause rhythm and intensity rhythm, of accelerometer data are relatively stable at various sampling rates. On this basis, we propose an eavesdropping approach with the accelerometer at an extremely-low sampling rate. Introducing the rhythm features, we achieve an accuracy of 95.09\\% at 50Hz and 78.66\\% at 5Hz for scene recognition. The accuracy is 90.60\\% at 50Hz and 47\\% at 5Hz for Chinese digits recognition, plus 96.63\\% at 50Hz and 58.67\\% at 5Hz for popular Chinese cities recognition. Furthermore, we achieve determination for typical places like bar, metro, bus, car, and quiet room, by analyzing the vibration of surroundings, with an average accuracy of 91.28\\%. Combining place determination with eavesdropping, our approach poses a serious threat to personal privacy. Since 5Hz is generally used for screen orientation detection, our attack can hide in any kind of application, not just in game or sport applications. We also suggest some countermeasures."

The inclusion of a unique identifier in the form of a UAV serial number has stoked fears that the identifier will be used to track UAV operators and has even led some UAV operators to file a lawsuit against the FAA.In this paper, we propose CAPSID, an implementation of the FAA session ID concept that provides message authentication-something current Remote ID implementations lack-and strong operator anonymity. The FAA (or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) retains the ability to de-anonymize operators, but only in circumstances prescribed by law. To make this possible, CAPSID introduces a partially trusted third party, the Custodian, that serves as the bridge between anonymous identifiers and true operator identity. The Custodian ensures that the legal requirements for de-anonymization are met, preventing unnecessary mass collection of personally identifying information by a government agency.We formally verify the message authentication property of CAPSID using a cryptographic protocol checker and provide a formal proof of identifier non-linkability, even in the presence of corrupt (but non-colluding) authorities."

A key issue is that the information of the same fingerprint may exist on multiple devices, and device-level protection mechanisms are fundamentally limited in their coverage. Consequently, information leakage from any device potentially affects all enrolled fingerprint recognition devices. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprint enrollment method called MaskPrint, which allows users to enroll in various fingerprint recognition systems using distinct information. This approach can largely mitigate the risk of data breaches, providing a user-transparent, device-agnostic fingerprint protection measure. Our method involves collecting the original fingerprint information, selecting a minimum feature set, synthesizing protective fingerprints, and fabricating physical ones for enrollment. Users can complete these procedures on their own. We validate the effectiveness and usability of MaskPrint on commercial fingerprint recognition systems."

This long-standing open problem has prompted many efforts to design such an encryption function, for example, NeuraCrypt and TransNet. Nonetheless, all existing constructions are heuristic without formal privacy guarantees, and many successful reconstruction attacks are known on these constructions assuming an adversary with substantial prior knowledge.We present both generic possibility and impossibility results pertaining to learnable obfuscation. On one hand, we demonstrate that any non-trivial, property-preserving transformation which enables effectively learning over encoded samples cannot offer cryptographic computational security in the worst case. On the other hand, from the lens of information-theoretical security, we devise a series of new tools to produce provable and useful privacy guarantees from a set of heuristic obfuscation methods, including matrix masking, data mixing and permutation, through noise perturbation. Under the framework of PAC Privacy, we show how to quantify the leakage from the learnable obfuscation built upon obfuscation and perturbation methods against adversarial inference. Significantly sharpened utility-privacy tradeoffs are achieved compared to state-of-the-art accounting methods when measuring privacy against data reconstruction and membership inference attacks."

Physical attacks can corrupt the RAVs' sensors, resulting in mission failures. Recovering RAVs from such attacks demands robust control techniques that maintain compliance with mission specifications even under attacks to ensure the RAV's safety and timely operations.We propose SpecGuard, a technique that complies with mission specifications and performs safe recovery of RAVs. There are two innovations in SpecGuard. First, it introduces an approach to incorporate mission specifications and learn a recovery control policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL). We design a compliance-based reward structure that reflects the RAV's complex dynamics and enables SpecGuard to satisfy multiple mission specifications simultaneously. Second, SpecGuard incorporates state reconstruction, a technique that minimizes attack induced sensor perturbations. This reconstruction enables effective adversarial training, and optimizing the recovery control policy for robustness under attacks. We evaluate SpecGuard in both virtual and real RAVs, and find that it achieves 92\\% recovery success rate under attacks on different sensors, without any crashes or stalls. SpecGuard achieves 2X higher recovery success than prior work, and incurs about 15\\% performance overhead on real RAVs."

This VPM adopts various Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to process the data collected from cameras and LiDAR. Prior studies have shown that these models are vulnerable to physical adversarial examples (PAEs), which pose a critical safety risk to the autonomous driving task. While a few defense methods have been proposed to safeguard AVs, most of them only target a limited set of attack types and specific scenarios, making them impractical for real-world protection.In this paper, we introduce VisionGuard, a novel and practical methodology to comprehensively detect and mitigate various types of PAEs to the VPM. The key of VisionGuard is to leverage the spatiotemporal inconsistency property of PAEs to detect anomalies. It predicts the motion states from historical ones and compares them with the current driving states to identify any motion inconsistency caused by physical attacks. We evaluate 9 state-of-the-art PAEs against both camera and camera-LiDAR fusion-based object classification \\&amp; detection models.

We developed PhyScout, a holistic sensor spoofing defense framework to overcome the above limitations.

We commence by defining the generalized conflicts that different sensor spoofing attacks produce regarding the spatio-temporal consistency. These conflicts are subsequently unified and formalized through a least squares problem approach. This process is modeled using image-based feature point extraction and matching techniques, followed by the design of a risk identification method for each conflict.We evaluate PhyScout across various environments, including simulators, datasets, and real-world scenarios. Compared to existing defense solutions, PhyScout offers rapid identification of sensor attacks (within 100ms) with low performance overhead (CPU-based), and conflict visualization. It demonstrates a fresh paradigm in autonomous vehicle security and presents new avenues for future research in robust and efficient defense mechanisms against sensor spoofing attacks.

Notably, recent works show that this model is outdated and that a more potent and versatile model could soon become the norm, prompting the need for a new defense paradigm. Unfortunately, the security impact of this emerging model on CAN systems has not received sufficient attention, and the defense systems addressing it are almost nonexistent.

    "abstract": "Current implementations of differentially-private (DP) systems either lack support to track the global privacy budget consumed on a dataset, or fail to faithfully maintain the state continuity of this budget. We show that failure to maintain a privacy budget enables an adversary to mount replay, rollback and fork attacks --- obtaining answers to many more queries than what a secure system would allow. As a result the attacker can reconstruct secret data that DP aims to protect --- even if DP code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose ElephantDP, a system that aims to provide the same guarantees as a trusted curator in the global DP model would, albeit set in an untrusted environment. Our system relies on a state continuity module to provide protection for the privacy budget and a TEE to faithfully execute DP code and update the budget. To provide security, our protocol makes several design choices including the content of the persistent state and the order between budget updates and query answers. We prove that ElephantDP provides liveness (i.e., the protocol can restart from a correct state and respond to queries as long as the budget is not exceeded) and DP confidentiality (i.e., an attacker learns about a dataset as much as it would from interacting with a trusted curator). Our implementation and evaluation of the protocol use Intel SGX as a TEE to run the DP code and a network of TEEs to maintain state continuity. Compared to an insecure baseline, we observe 1.1--3.2\\texttimes{} overheads and lower relative overheads for complex DP queries."

    "abstract": "Differentially private mechanisms achieving worst-case optimal error bounds (e.g., the classical Laplace mechanism) are well-studied in the literature. However, when typical data are far from the worst case, instance-specific error bounds---which depend on the largest value in the dataset---are more meaningful. For example, consider the sum estimation problem, where each user has an integer xi from the domain {0,1,...,U} and we wish to estimate ∑i xi. This has a worst-case optimal error of O(U/ε), while recent work has shown that the clipping mechanism can achieve an instance-optimal error of O(maxi xi ⋅ log log U /ε). Under the shuffle model, known instance-optimal protocols are less communication-efficient. The clipping mechanism also works in the shuffle model, but requires two rounds: Round one finds the clipping threshold, and round two does the clipping and computes the noisy sum of the clipped data. In this paper, we show how these two seemingly sequential steps can be done simultaneously in one round using just 1+o(1) messages per user, while maintaining the instance-optimal error bound. We also extend our technique to the high-dimensional sum estimation problem and sparse vector aggregation (a.k.a. frequency estimation under user-level differential privacy)."

At the core of our design is a distributed private information retrieval (PIR) protocol, where the responder delegates its work to alleviate PIR's computational bottleneck and catches misbehaving delegates by efficiently verifying their results. We introduce DPIR, a messaging system that uses distributed PIR to let a server storing messages delegate the work to the system's clients, such that each client contributes proportional processing to the number of messages it reads. The server removes clients returning invalid results, which DPIR leverages to integrate an incentive mechanism for honest client behavior by conditioning messaging through DPIR on correctly processing PIR requests from other users. The result is a metadata-private messaging system that asymptotically improves scalability over prior work with the same threat model. We show through experiments on a prototype implementation that DPIR concretely improves performance by 3.25\\texttimes{} and 4.31\\texttimes{} over prior work [3, 5] and that the performance gap grows with the user base~size."

This design hides communications metadata, such as version and length fields, and makes it difficult to even determine what protocol is being used. Moreover, these protocols frequently support padding to hide the length of protocol fields and the contained message. These techniques have relevance well beyond censorship circumvention, as protecting protocol metadata has security and privacy benefits for all Internet communications. The security of FEP designs depends on cryptographic assumptions, but neither security definitions nor proofs exist for them. We provide novel security definitions that capture the metadata-protection goals of FEPs. Our definitions are given in both the datastream and datagram settings, which model the ubiquitous TCP and UDP interfaces available to protocol designers. We prove relations among these new notions and existing security definitions. We further present new FEP constructions and prove their security. Finally, we survey existing FEP candidates and characterize the extent to which they satisfy FEP security. We identify novel ways in which these protocols are identifiable, including their responses to the introduction of data errors and the sizes of their smallest protocol messages."

    "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks identify the websites visited by users by performing traffic analysis, compromising user privacy. Particularly, DL-based WF attacks demonstrate impressive attack performance. However, the effectiveness of DL-based WF attacks relies on the collected complete and pure traffic during the page loading, which impacts the practicality of these attacks. The WF performance is rather low under dynamic network conditions and various WF defenses, particularly when the analyzed traffic is only a small part of the complete traffic. In this paper, we propose Holmes, a robust and reliable early-stage WF attack. Holmes utilizes temporal and spatial distribution analysis of website traffic to effectively identify websites in the early stages of page loading. Specifically, Holmes develops adaptive data augmentation based on the temporal distribution of website traffic and utilizes a supervised contrastive learning method to extract the correlations between the early-stage traffic and the pre-collected complete traffic. Holmes accurately identifies traffic in the early stages of page loading by computing the correlation of the traffic with the spatial distribution information, which ensures robust and reliable detection according to early-stage traffic. We extensively evaluate Holmes using six datasets. Compared to nine existing DL-based WF attacks, Holmes improves the F1-score of identifying early-stage traffic by an average of 169.18\\%. Furthermore, we replay the traffic of visiting real-world dark web websites. Holmes successfully identifies dark web websites when the ratio of page loading on average is only 21.71\\%, with an average precision improvement of 169.36\\% over the existing WF attacks."

    "abstract": "In the realm of privacy-preserving blockchain applications such as Zcash, oblivious message retrieval (OMR) enables recipients to privately access messages directed to them on blockchain nodes (or bulletin board servers). OMR prevents servers from linking a message and its corresponding recipient's address, thereby safeguarding recipient privacy. Several OMR schemes have emerged recently to meet the demands of these privacy-centric blockchains; however, we observe that existing solutions exhibit shortcomings in various critical aspects and may only achieve certain objectives inefficiently, sometimes relying on trusted hardware, thereby impacting their practical utility. This work introduces a novel OMR protocol, HomeRun, that leverages two semi-honest, non-colluding servers to excel in both performance and security attributes as compared to the current state-of-the-art.HomeRun stands out by providing unlinkability across multiple requests for the same recipient's address. Moreover, it does not impose a limit on the number of pertinent messages that can be received by a recipient, which thwarts \"message balance exhaustion'' attacks and enhances system usability. HomeRun also empowers servers to regularly delete the retrieved messages and the associated auxiliary data, which mitigates the constantly increasing computation costs and storage costs incurred by servers. Remarkably, none of the existing solutions offer all of these features collectively. Finally, thanks to our judicious use of highly efficient cryptographic building blocks, HomeRun is highly performant: Specifically, the total runtime of servers in HomeRun is 3830 \\texttimes{} less than that in the work by Liu et al. (CRYPTO '22) based on fully-homomorphic encryption, and at least 1459 \\texttimes{} less than that in the design by Madathil et al.

In this work, we devise a fuzzing framework that performantly fuzzes cellular interfaces accessible from a base station or user device, overcoming several challenges in fuzzing specific to LTE/5G network components. We also introduce ASNFuzzGen, a tool that compiles ASN.1 specifications into structure-aware fuzzing modules, thereby facilitating effective fuzzing exploration of complex cellular protocols. We run fuzzing campaigns against seven open-source and commercial cores and discover 119 vulnerabilities, with 93 CVEs assigned. Our results reveal common implementation mistakes across several cores that lead to vulnerabilities, and the successful coordination of patches for these vulnerabilities across several vendors demonstrates the practical impact ASNFuzzGen has on hardening user-exposed cellular systems."

    "abstract": "Consumers seeking a new mobile plan have many choices in the present mobile landscape. The Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) has recently gained considerable attention among these options. MVNOs offer various benefits, making them an appealing choice for a majority of consumers. These advantages encompass flexibility, access to cutting-edge technologies, enhanced coverage, superior customer service, and substantial cost savings. Even though MVNO offers several advantages, it also creates some security and privacy concerns for the customer simultaneously. For instance, in the existing solution, MVNO needs to hand over all the sensitive details, including the users' identities and master secret keys of their customers, to a mobile operator (MNO) to validate the customers while offering any services. This allows MNOs to have unrestricted access to the MVNO subscribers' location and mobile data, including voice calls, SMS, and Internet, which the MNOs frequently sell to third parties (e.g., advertisement companies and surveillance agencies) for more profit. Although critical for mass users, such privacy loss has been historically ignored due to the lack of practical and privacy-preserving solutions for registration and handover procedures in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a universally composable authentication and handover scheme with strong user privacy support, where each MVNO user can validate a mobile operator (MNO) and vice-versa without compromising user anonymity and unlinkability support. Here, we anticipate that our proposed solution will most likely be deployed by the MVNO(s) to ensure enhanced privacy support to their customer(s)."

    "abstract": "Home wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are increasingly gaining popularity for their superior extensibility and signal coverage compared to traditional single-AP wireless networks. In particular, there is a single gateway node and multiple extender nodes that cooperate to provide wireless coverage. We observe that there is no comprehensive research conducted on the security aspects of the control plane of such networks. For example, this decentralized architecture enables each extender node to independently authenticate wireless clients by synchronizing access control policies from the gateway node. However, this synchronization unexpectedly opens an attack surface which has not been scrutinized.In our research, we conduct an empirical study investigating devices and protocols of six popular home wireless mesh network vendors, focusing on the attack surface introduced by the access policy synchronization. Interestingly, we find that the exact protocols used to support such functionalities vary by vendors, despite the existence of the EasyMesh standard that vendors could opt-in. Furthermore, we find a number of serious security flaws, including but not limited to malicious clients retaining their network access indefinitely and direct compromises of gateway and extender nodes in some cases. These issues arise due to the lack of coordination across different layers of protocols that work together to support the control plane. We reported all of our findings to the affected vendors and they have acknowledged the issues and are working towards fixes (most of the vendors have released patches). Finally, we discuss trade-offs in different existing designs, suggest alternative solutions, and summarize lessons learned from the research."

    "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short-range wireless communication technology for resource-constrained IoT devices. Unfortunately, BLE is vulnerable to session-based attacks, where previous packets construct exploitable conditions for subsequent packets to compromise connections. Defending against session-based attacks is challenging because each step in the attack sequence is legitimate when inspected individually. In this paper, we present BlueSWAT, a lightweight state-aware security framework for protecting BLE devices. To perform inspection on the session level rather than individual packets, BlueSWAT leverages a finite state machine (FSM) to monitor sequential actions of connections at runtime. Patterns of session-based attacks are modeled as malicious transition paths in the FSM. To overcome the heterogeneous IoT environment, we develop a lightweight eBPF framework to facilitate universal patch distribution across different BLE architectures and stacks, without requiring device reboot. We implement BlueSWAT on 5 real-world devices with different chips and stacks to demonstrate its cross-device adaptability. On our dataset with 101 real-world BLE vulnerabilities, BlueSWAT can mitigate 76.1\\% of session-based attacks, outperforming other defense frameworks. In our end-to-end application evaluation, BlueSWAT introduces an average of 0.073\\% memory overhead and negligible latency."

    "abstract": "Browser extensions are third-party add-ons that provide myriads of features to their users while browsing on the Web. Extensions often interact with the websites a user visits and perform various operations such as DOM-based manipulation, script injections, and so on. However, this also enables nefarious websites to track their visitors by fingerprinting extensions. Researchers in the past have shown that extensions are susceptible to fingerprinting based on the resources they include, the styles they deploy, or the DOM-based modifications they perform. Fortunately, the current extension ecosystem contains safeguards against many such known issues through appropriate defense mechanisms.We present the first study to investigate the fingerprinting characteristics of extension-injected code in pages' JavaScript namespace and through other observable side-effects like changed cookies. Doing so, we find that many extensions inject JavaScript that pollutes the applications' global namespace by registering variables. It also enables the attacker application to monitor the execution of the injected code by overwriting the JavaScript APIs and capturing execution traces through the stacktrace, the set of APIs invoked, etc. Further, extensions also store data on the client side and perform event-driven functionalities that aid in attribution. Through our tests, we find 2,747 Chrome and 572 Firefox extensions to be susceptible to fingerprinting. Unfortunately, none of the existing defense mechanisms prevent extensions from being fingerprinted through our proposed vectors. Therefore, we also suggest potential measures for developers and browser vendors to safeguard the extension ecosystem against such fingerprinting attempts."

Within this ecosystem, miscreants utilize cross-platform referral traffic to advertise and promote illicit drugs. They start by posting illicit drug-promoting comments on upstream social media platforms, attracting potential drug buyers, and then redirecting these buyers to downstream platforms where the actual drug sales take place. To the best of our knowledge, little has been done so far to understand this cross-platform referral traffic for illicit drug promotion and selling on social media platforms, not to mention any effort to systematically identify such referral traffic on social media platforms. In this paper, we designed an automated pipeline for detecting illicit referral traffic and identified 154,753 drug-referral comments and 3,253 drug sellers. Based upon the dataset, we presented the first systematic study on the ecosystem of such cross-platform illicit drug promotion and selling businesses, which sheds light on the strategies and campaigns of illicit drug promotion.

Phishing has been identified as one of the prime cyber threats in recent years. With the goal to effectively identify and mitigate phishing as early as possible, we present in this paper a longitudinal analysis of phishing attacks from the vantage point of three country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) registries that manage more than 8 million active domains -- namely the Netherlands' .nl, Ireland's .ie, and Belgium's .be. We perform a longitudinal analysis on phishing attacks spanning up to 10 years, based on more than 28 thousand phishing domains. Our results show two major attack strategies: national companies and organizations are far more often impersonated using malicious registered domains under their country's own ccTLD, which enables better mimicry of the impersonated company. In stark contrast, international companies are impersonated using any domains that can be compromised, reducing overall mimicry but bearing no registration and financial costs. Although most research works focus on detecting new domain names, we show that 80\\% of phishing attacks in the studied ccTLDs employ compromised domain names. We find banks, financial institutions, and high-tech giant companies at the top of the most impersonated targets. We also show the impact of ccTLDs' registration and abuse handling policies on preventing and mitigating phishing attacks, and that mitigation is complex and performed at both web and DNS level at different intermediaries. Last, our results provide a unique opportunity for ccTLDs to compare and revisit their policies and impacts, with the goal of improving mitigation procedures."

We begin with a survey and selection of three metaverse platforms and introduce a software-centric threat modeling approach designed to identify the security-relevant entities. Then, we propose a JavaScript global object snapshot diffing technique to identify in-memory objects correlated with the attribute and design 10 attacks, of which eight successfully executed against at least one of the metaverses, enabling a malicious user to perform audio/video surveillance or continuous user position tracking - to mention a few - who could exacerbate current threats posed by stalkers and online abusers.

Existing privacy-enhancing content-blocking tools struggle against mixed scripts, which simultaneously implement both functionality and tracking. Blocking such scripts would break functionality, and not blocking them would allow tracking. We propose Not.js, a fine-grained JavaScript blocking tool that operates at the function-level granularity. Not.js's strengths lie in analyzing the dynamic execution context, including the call stack and calling context of each JavaScript function, and then encoding this context to build a rich graph representation. Not.js trains a supervised machine learning classifier on a webpage's graph representation to first detect tracking at the function-level and then automatically generates surrogate scripts that preserve functionality while removing tracking. Our evaluation of Not.js on the top-10K websites demonstrates that it achieves high precision (94\\%) and recall (98\\%) in detecting tracking functions, outperforming the state-of-the-art while being robust against off-the-shelf JavaScript obfuscation. Fine-grained detection of tracking functions allows Not.js to automatically generate surrogate scripts, which our evaluation shows that successfully remove tracking functions without causing major breakage.

    "abstract": "Despite the promising advances in deepfake detection on current datasets, detecting visual deepfakes in real-world scenarios (e.g., deepfake videos and live streaming on YouTube) remains a challenge due to the inherent quality degradation such as unpredictable compression employed by social media platforms. Such degradation perturbs discernible forgery clues and diminishes the effectiveness of deepfake detection methods, raising a critical safety concern to the misuse of forgery faces in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we aim to understand the impacts of real-world degradation on the robustness of deepfake detection. Particularly, we investigate the risk of degraded deepfakes towards their detection on two real-world scenarios (i.e., deepfake videos and deepfake live streaming on social media platforms). By measuring the effects of real-world degradations on the performance and representation capabilities of detection models, we reveal that real-world deepfakes can be simulated via common degradation operations (e.g., JPEG compression) as they are perceptually similar to deepfake detectors. By analyzing the training dynamics under different sequences of training samples, we observe that the training order of deepfakes progressing from non-degraded (easy) to heavily degraded (hard) enhances the adaptability of detection models to various degradation in real-world scenarios. Drawing from these observations, we present a novel deepfake detection method ProFake to enhance the robustness of deepfake detection against real-world quality degradations. ProFake enables quality-adaptive learning via progressively degrade, detect and assign weights for the training samples driven by the feedback of model performance and image quality, which ensures that our model gradually focuses on more challenging samples to achieve quality-adaptive deepfake detection. Extensive experiments show that compared with existing methods, ProFake improves deepfake detection accuracy by an average of over 10 \\% in real-world scenarios and by an average of over 30 \\% in heavily degraded scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance in detecting high-quality deepfakes."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, powerful large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated revolutionary power in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and question-answering. Consequently, the detection of machine-generated texts (MGTs) is becoming increasingly crucial as LLMs become more advanced and prevalent. These models have the ability to generate human-like language, making it challenging to discern whether a text is authored by a human or a machine. This raises concerns regarding authenticity, accountability, and potential bias. However, existing methods for detecting MGTs are evaluated using different model architectures, datasets, and experimental settings, resulting in a lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework that encompasses various methodologies. Furthermore, it remains unclear how existing detection methods would perform against powerful LLMs.In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing the first benchmark framework for MGT detection against powerful LLMs, named MGTBench. Extensive evaluations on public datasets with curated texts generated by various powerful LLMs such as ChatGPT-turbo and Claude demonstrate the effectiveness of different detection methods. Our ablation study shows that a larger number of words in general leads to better performance and most detection methods can achieve similar performance with much fewer training samples. Additionally, our findings reveal that metric-based/model-based detection methods exhibit better transferability across different LLMs/datasets. Furthermore, we delve into a more challenging task: text attribution, where the goal is to identify the originating model of a given text, i.e., whether it is a specific LLM or authored by a human. Our findings indicate that the model-based detection methods still perform well in the text attribution task. To investigate the robustness of different detection methods, we consider three adversarial attacks, namely paraphrasing, random spacing, and adversarial perturbations. We discover that these attacks can significantly diminish detection effectiveness, underscoring the critical need for the development of more robust detection methods. We envision that MGTBench will serve as a benchmark tool to accelerate future investigations involving the evaluation of powerful MGT detection methods on their respective datasets and the development of more advanced MGT detection methods."

Therefore, automatic optimization of LLM prompts for generating secure and functioning code is a demanding need. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for &lt;u&gt;prom&lt;/u&gt;pt optimization for &lt;u&gt;sec&lt;/u&gt;ure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate the code-clearing and generation loop as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. As a result, PromSec becomes a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure and functioning codes.Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that despite the comprehensive application of a state-of-the-art approach, it falls short in addressing all vulnerabilities within the code, whereas PromSec effectively resolves each of them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operational time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study presents an essential step towards improving the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functioning code generation, significantly enhancing their large-scale integration in real-world software code development practices."

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services."

    "abstract": "Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such vulnerabilities, Rust, a performant memory-safe systems language, provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. Rust interoperability enables developing Rust applications on top of existing C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and challenges of using Rust for embedded systems. Our study is organized across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 6,408 Rust embedded software spanning various categories and 6 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research questions. We found that existing Rust software support is inadequate, SAST tools cannot handle certain features of Rust embedded software, resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing Rust software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using Rust for embedded systems development."

    "abstract": "In modern mobile devices, baseband is an integral component running on top of cellular processors to handle crucial radio communications. However, recent research reveals significant vulnerabilities in these basebands, posing serious security risks like remote code execution. Yet, effectively scrutinizing basebands remains a daunting task, as they run closed-source and proprietary software on vendor-specific chipsets. Existing analysis methods are limited by their dependence on manual processes and heuristic approaches, reducing their scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach to unveil security issues in basebands from a unique perspective: to uncover vendor-specific baseband commands from the Radio Interface Layer (RIL), a hardware abstraction layer interfacing with basebands. To demonstrate this concept, we have designed and developed BaseMirror, a static binary analysis tool to automatically reverse engineer baseband commands from vendor-specific RIL binaries. It utilizes a bidirectional taint analysis algorithm to adeptly identify baseband commands from an enhanced control flow graph enriched with reconstructed virtual function calls. Our methodology has been applied to 28 vendor RIL libraries, encompassing a wide range of Samsung Exynos smartphone models on the market. Remarkably, BaseMirror has uncovered 873 unique baseband commands undisclosed to the public. Based on these results, we develop an automated attack discovery framework to successfully derive and validate 8 zero-day vulnerabilities that trigger denial of cellular service and arbitrary file access on a Samsung Galaxy A53 device. These findings have been reported and confirmed by Samsung and a bug bounty was awarded to us."

    "abstract": "Ransomware attacks have emerged as one of the most significant cybersecurity threats. Despite numerous methods proposed for detecting and defending against ransomware, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations in large-scale industrial applications: (1) Behavior-based detection engines suffer from the enormous overhead of monitoring all processes and resource constraints for model inference, failing to meet the requirements for real-time detection; (2) Decoy-based detection engines generate an overwhelming number of false positives in large-scale industrial clusters, leading to intolerable disruptions to critical processes and excessive inspection efforts from security analysts. To address these challenges, we propose CanCal, a real-time and lightweight ransomware detection system. Specifically, instead of indiscriminately analyzing all processes, CanCal selectively filters suspicious processes by the monitoring layers and then performs in-depth behavioral analysis to isolate ransomware activities from benign operations, minimizing alert fatigue while ensuring lightweight computational and storage overhead. The experimental results on a large-scale industrial environment (1,761 ransomware, ~ 3 million events, continuous test over 5 months) indicate that CanCal achieves a remarkable 99.65\\% true positive rate on 555,678 unknown ransomware behavior events, with near-zero false positives. CanCal is as effective as state-of-the-art techniques while enabling rapid inference within 30ms and real-time response within a maximum of 3 seconds. CanCal dramatically reduces average CPU utilization by 91.04\\% (from 6.7\\% to 0.6\\%) and peak CPU utilization by 76.69\\% (from 26.6\\% to 6.2\\%), while avoiding 76.50\\% (from 3,192 to 750) of the inspection efforts from security analysts. By the time of this writing, CanCal has been integrated into a commercial product and successfully deployed on 3.32 million endpoints for over a year. From March 2023 to April 2024, CanCal successfully detected and thwarted 61 ransomware attacks. A detailed manual forensic analysis of 27 ransomware attacks from March to June 2023 (including 13 n-day exploits and 5 high-risk zero-day attacks) demonstrates the effectiveness of CanCal in combating sophisticated and unknown ransomware threats in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Due to the diversity of architectures and peripherals of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, blackbox fuzzing stands out as a prime option for discovering vulnerabilities of IoT devices. Existing blackbox fuzzing tools often rely on companion apps to generate valid fuzzing packets. However, existing methods encounter the challenges of bypassing the cloud server side validation when it comes to fuzz devices that rely on cloud-based communication. Moreover, they tend to concentrate their efforts on Java components within Android companion apps, limiting their effectiveness in assessing non-Java components such as JavaScript-based mini-apps. In this paper, we introduce a novel blackbox fuzzing method, named RIoTFuzzer, designed to remotely uncover vulnerabilities of IoT devices with the assistance of companion apps, particularly those powered by All-in-one Apps with the JavaScript-based mini-apps feature enabled. Our approach utilizes document-based control command extraction, hybrid analysis for mutation point identification and side-channel-guided fuzzing to effectively address the challenges of fuzzing IoT devices remotely. We apply RIoTFuzzer to 27 IoT devices on prominent platforms and discovered 11 vulnerabilities. All of them have been acknowledged by the corresponding vendors. 8 have been confirmed by the vendors and have been assigned 4 CVE IDs. Our experiment results also demonstrate that side-channel-guided fuzzing can significantly enhance the efficiency of fuzzing packets sent to IoT devices, with an average increase of 76.62\\% and a maximum increase of 362.62\\%."

    "abstract": "The widespread integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices in respectively home and business environments offers both benefits and perils. While these devices, such as IP cameras and network routers improve operational efficiency with their user-friendly web interfaces, they also broaden the potential for cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Recent studies highlight the vulnerability of these devices to taint-based attacks, demonstrating that even attackers with limited permissions can gain control of a device. Current state-of-the-art solutions for mitigating these risks primarily utilize Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE). Although effective, DSE is computationally costly and challenging for large-scale analysis. Besides, during inspection, these approaches typically exhibit over-taint behavior by producing a large number of alerts, many of which are false positives due to ineffective handling of sanitization measures that might be in place. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OctopusTaint, an innovative static-based taint analysis approach that integrates advanced data flow analysis with backtracking techniques. OctopusTaint is distinguished by its integration of a sanitization inspection module and sophisticated post-processing filters. These features are specifically designed to minimize false positives effectively while ensuring the accurate identification of genuine security threats. OctopusTaint also excels in tracking transformed tainted inputs across NVRAM, identifying new user-defined taint source functions while addressing the challenges associated with indirect calls and aliasing. Through comparative performance evaluations, OctopusTaint demonstrates superior performance over the current state-of-the-art solutions, SaTC, EmTaint, and MangoDFA. It reports genuine extra tainted sinks in considerable less time (24\\% faster). Furthermore, OctopusTaint identifies 82\\% of tainted sinks within EmTaint 's labeled dataset while exhibiting its advanced capability in sanitization inspection. It correctly flags as sanitized 320 sinks, which were misidentified as genuine alerts by EmTaint. Furthermore, OctopusTaint uncovers additional candidates overlooked by EmTaint, leveraging its enhanced detection mechanisms for new taint sources. OctopusTaint successfully identifies 142 n -day vulnerabilities previously reported by SaTC and EmTaint, in addition to discovering dozens of potential 0-day candidates."

Prompt patching is crucial to mitigate the serious consequences of such attacks on these devices. Hotpatching is an approach to apply a patch to mission-critical embedded devices without rebooting them. However, existing hotpatching approaches require developers to manually write the hotpatch for target systems, which is time-consuming and error-prone.To address these issues, we propose AutoPatch, a new hotpatching technique that automatically generates functionally equivalent hotpatches via static analysis of the official patches. AutoPatch introduces a new software triggering approach that supports diverse embedded devices, and preserves the functionality of the official patch. In contrast to prior work, AutoPatch does not rely on hardware support for triggering patches, or on executing patches in specialized virtual machines. We implemented AutoPatch using the LLVM compiler, and evaluated its efficiency, effectiveness and generality using 62 real CVEs on four embedded devices with different specifications and architectures running popular RTOSes. We found that AutoPatch can fix more than 90\\% of CVEs, and resolve the vulnerability successfully. The results revealed an average total delay of less than 12.7 μs for fixing the vulnerabilities, representing a performance improvement of 50\\% over RapidPatch, a state-of-the-art approach. Further, our memory overhead, on average, was slightly lower than theirs (23\\%). Finally, AutoPatch was able to generate hotpatches for all four devices without any modifications."

Censors use a variety of techniques to identify content they wish to block, including filtering traffic patterns that are characteristic of proxy or circumvention protocols and actively probing potential proxy servers. Circumvention practitioners have developed fully encrypted protocols (FEPs), intended to have traffic that appears indistinguishable from random. A FEP is typically composed of a key exchange protocol to establish shared secret keys, and then a secure channel protocol to encrypt application data; both must avoid revealing to observers that an obfuscated protocol is in use.We formalize the notion of obfuscated key exchange, capturing the requirement that a key exchange protocol's traffic \"looks random\" and that it resists active probing attacks, in addition to ensuring secure session keys and authentication. We show that the Tor network's obfs4 protocol satisfies this definition. We then show how to extend the obfs4 design to defend against stronger censorship attacks and present a quantum-safe obfuscated key exchange protocol. To instantiate our quantum-safe protocol using the ML-KEM (Kyber) standard, we present Kemeleon, a new mapping between ML-KEM public keys/ciphertexts and uniform byte strings."

    "abstract": "The recently standardized secure group messaging protocol Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is designed to ensure asynchronous communications within large groups, with an almost-optimal communication cost and the same security level as point-to-point secure messaging protocols such as Signal. In particular, the core sub-protocol of MLS, a Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) called TreeKEM, must generate a common group key that respects the fundamental security properties of post-compromise security and forward secrecy which mitigate the effects of user corruption over timeMost research on CGKAs has focused on how to improve these two security properties. However, post-compromise security and forward secrecy require the active participation of respectively all compromised users and all users within the group. Inactive users - who remain offline for long periods - do not update anymore their encryption keys and therefore represent a vulnerability for the entire group. This issue has already been identified in the MLS standard, but no solution, other than expelling these inactive users after some disconnection time, has been found.We propose here a CGKA protocol based on TreeKEM and fully compatible with the MLS standard, that implements a quarantine mechanism for the inactive users in order to mitigate the risk induced by these users during their inactivity period and before they are removed from the group. That mechanism indeed updates the inactive users' encryption keys on their behalf and secures these keys with a secret sharing scheme. If some of the inactive users eventually reconnect, their quarantine stops and they are able to recover all the messages that were exchanged during their offline period. Our Quarantined-TreeKEM protocol thus increases the security of original TreeKEM, with a very limited - and sometimes negative - communication overhead."

    "abstract": "Most cryptographic protocols model a player's knowledge of secrets in a simple way. Informally, the player knows a secret in the sense that she can directly furnish it as a (private) input to a protocol, e.g., to digitally sign a message. The growing availability of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and multiparty computation (MPC), however, undermines this model of knowledge. Such tools can encumber a secret sk and permit a chosen player to access sk conditionally, without actually knowing sk. By permitting selective access to sk by an adversary, encumbrance of secrets can enable vote-selling in cryptographic voting schemes, illegal sale of credentials for online services, and erosion of deniability in anonymous messaging systems. Unfortunately, existing proof-of-knowledge protocols fail to demonstrate that a secret is unencumbered. We therefore introduce and formalize a new notion called complete knowledge (CK). A proof (or argument) of CK shows that a prover does not just know a secret, but also has fully unencumbered knowledge, i.e., unrestricted ability to use the secret. We introduce two practical CK schemes that use special-purpose hardware, specifically TEEs and off-the-shelf mining ASICs. We prove the security of these schemes and explore their practical deployment with a complete, open-source, end-to-end prototype with smart-contract verification that supports both. We show how CK can address encumbrance attacks identified in previous work. Finally, we introduce two new applications enabled by CK that involve proving ownership of blockchain assets."

    "abstract": "NIST released the draft standard for ML-KEM, and we can expect its widespread use in the embedded world in the near future. Several side-channel attacks have been proposed, and one line of research has focused on attacks against the comparison step of the FO-transform. A work published at TCHES 2022 stressed the need for secure higher-order masked comparisons beyond the t-probing model and proposed a higher-order masked comparison method. Subsequently, D'Anvers, Van Beirendonck, and Verbauwhede improved upon the performance of several previous proposals; their higher-order masked algorithm currently achieves the highest performance for masked comparisons. In this work, we show that while this proposal is secure in the t-probing model, its security in practice is questionable. We first propose an approximate template attack that requires only a small number of traces for profiling and has an exceptionally high noise tolerance. We demonstrate that, without knowledge of the targeted values, a vertical analysis of the distribution of certain points of interest can replace the profiling phase. Finally, we explain how a decryption failure oracle may be constructed from a single trace.We prove that these attacks are not affected by higher masking orders for noise levels that by far prevent previous profiled attacks on ML-KEM. Further, we provide simulations showing that even under extreme noise levels, the attacks are not prevented by realistic masking orders.Additionally, we carry out the attacks on multiple physical devices to stress the practicality of our attack. We discuss the underlying causes for our attack, demonstrate the difficulty of securing the FO-transform in ML-KEM, draw conclusions about the (in-)sufficiency of t-probing security in this context, and highlight an open gap in securing ML-KEM on embedded devices."

The process is bootstrapped from a human-memorizable password only, addressing the challenge of how end-users can manage cryptographic key material. The core security requirement is protection against a corrupt server, which should not be able to learn the key or offline- attack it through the password protection. PPKR is deployed at a large scale with the WhatsApp Backup Protocol (WBP), allowing users to access their encrypted messaging history when switching to a new device. Davies et al. (Crypto'23) formally analyzed the WBP, proving that it satisfies most of the desired security. The WBP uses the OPAQUE protocol for password-based key exchange as a building block and relies on the server using a hardware security module (HSM) for most of its protection. In fact, the security analysis assumes that the HSM is incorruptible - rendering most of the heavy cryptography in the WBP obsolete. In this work, we explore how provably secure and efficient PPKR can be built that either relies strongly on an HSM - but then takes full advantage of that - or requires less trust assumption for the price of more advanced cryptography. To this end, we expand the definitional work by Davies et al. to allow the analysis of PPKR with fine-grained HSM corruption, such as leakage of user records or attestation keys. For each scenario, we aim to give minimal PPKR solutions. For the strongest corruption setting, namely a fully corrupted HSM, we propose a protocol with a simpler design and better efficiency than the WBP. We also fix an attack related to client authentication that was identified by Davies et al."

    "abstract": "Module Learning with Errors (MLWE) based approaches for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) have garnered attention due to their potential to enhance hardware-friendliness and implementation efficiency. However, despite these advantages, their overall performance still trails behind traditional schemes based on Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE). This indicates that while MLWE-based constructions hold promise, there remain significant challenges to overcome in bridging the performance gap with RLWE-based FHE schemes. By uncovering the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance of prior schemes and pinpointing the fundamental differences in the design of MLWE-based FHE compared to traditional approaches, the paper introduces DPad-HE with a novel design incorporating manipulation in the module rank dimension. The newly introduced operations, rank-up, and rank-down, effectively regulate the scale of gadget decomposition, reducing the computational workload of key-switching by several times. Taking CKKS as a case study, the evaluation showcases the comprehensive advantages of DPad-HE over the state-of-the-art MLWE-based scheme, resulting in a performance boost of 1.26\\texttimes{} to 5.71\\texttimes{}, a reduction in key size from 1/3 to 3/4, with enhanced noise control. To test the hardware-friendliness of the solution, DPad-HE is also implemented on GPU. Notably, DPad-HE demonstrates that, for the first time, the execution latency of MLWE-based schemes can achieve comparable performance with traditional RLWE ones, especially on the GPU platform where a speedup up to 1.41\\texttimes{} is witnessed. Additionally, this paper provides a lightweight conversion method between RLWE and MLWE ciphertexts, allowing for flexible selection of RLWE and MLWE settings during a single complete evaluation process. This opens up new possibilities for both RLWE-based and MLWE-based FHEs."

To achieve better efficiency, we develop an input-output packing technique that reduces the communication cost incurred by HE with coefficient encoding by about 21\\texttimes{}, and propose a split-point picking technique that reduces the number of rotations to that sublinear in the matrix dimension. Compared to the recent protocol HELiKs by Balla and Koushanfar (CCS'23), our implementation demonstrates that Rhombus improves the whole performance of an MVM protocol by a factor of 7.4x ~ 8x, and improves the end-to-end performance of secure two-party inference of ResNet50 by a factor of 4.6x ~ 18x."

    "abstract": "A recent security model for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), called IND-CPAD security and introduced by Li and Micciancio [Eurocrypt'21], strengthens IND-CPA security by giving the attacker access to a decryption oracle for ciphertexts for which it should know the underlying plaintexts. This includes ciphertexts that it (honestly) encrypted and those obtained from the latter by evaluating circuits that it chose. Li and Micciancio singled out the CKKS FHE scheme for approximate data [Asiacrypt'17] by giving an IND-CPAD attack on it and claiming that IND-CPA security and IND-CPAD security coincide for exact FHE schemes.We correct the widespread belief according to which IND-CPA^D attacks are specific to approximate homomorphic computations. Indeed, the equivalency formally proved by Li and Micciancio assumes that the schemes have a negligible probability of incorrect decryption. However, almost all competitive implementations of exact FHE schemes give away strong correctness by analyzing correctness heuristically and allowing noticeable probabilities of incorrect decryption.We exploit this imperfect correctness to mount efficient non-adaptive indistinguishability and key-recovery attacks against all major exact FHE schemes. We illustrate their strength by implementing them for BFV using OpenFHE and simulating an attack for the default parameter set of the CGGI implementation of TFHE-rs (the attack experiment is too expensive to be run on commodity desktops, because of the cost of CGGI bootstrapping). Our attacks extend to CKKS for discrete data, and threshold versions of the exact FHE schemes, when the correctness is similarly loose."

    "abstract": "Bootstrapping is currently the only known method for constructing fully homomorphic encryptions. In the BFV scheme specifically, bootstrapping aims to reduce the error of a ciphertext while preserving the encrypted plaintext. The existing BFV bootstrapping methods follow the same pipeline, relying on the evaluation of a digit extraction polynomial to annihilate the error located in the least significant digits. However, due to its strong dependence on performance, bootstrapping could only utilize a limited form of plaintext modulus, such as a power of a small prime number.In this paper, we present a novel approach to instantiate BFV bootstrapping, distinct from the previous digit extraction-based method. The core idea of our bootstrapping is to utilize CKKS bootstrapping as a subroutine, so the performance of our method mainly depends on the underlying CKKS bootstrapping rather than the plaintext modulus.We implement our method at a proof-of-concept level to provide concrete benchmark results. When performing the bootstrapping operation for a 51-bits plaintext modulus, our method improves the previous digit extraction-based method by a factor of 37.9 in latency and 29.4 in throughput. Additionally, we achieve viable bootstrapping performance for large plaintext moduli, such as 144-bits and 234-bits, which has never been measured before."

    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3670376",
    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption has known impressive improvements in the last 15 years, going from a technology long thought to be impossible to an existing family of encryption schemes able to solve a plethora of practical use cases related to the privacy of sensitive information. Recent results mainly focus on improving techniques within the traditionally defined framework of GLWE-based schemes, but the recent CPU implementation improvements are mainly incremental. To keep improving this technology, one solution is to modify the aforementioned framework, by using slightly different hardness assumptions.In this paper, we identify two limitations with (T)FHE: (i) there is no fine-grained control over the size of a GLWE secret key, which is traditionally composed of k polynomials with N=2α &gt;1 coefficients; (ii) for security reasons one cannot use a noise variance smaller than a certain σmin so, for all ciphertext modulus q ∈ N, there exists an integer nplateau such that, with any secret key of size k ⋅ N ≥ nplateau, one cannot control their level of security, resulting in unnecessary big security levels.To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce two new types of secret keys for GLWE-based cryptosystems, that can be used separately or together. We explain why these new secret keys are as secure as the traditional ones and we detail all the improvements that they bring to existing FHE algorithms alongside new algorithms especially efficient with these new keys. We provide many comparisons with state-of-the-art TFHE techniques with traditional secret keys, and some benchmarks showing computational speed-ups between 1.3 and 2.4 while keeping the same level of security and failure probability (correctness). Furthermore, the size of the key switching and bootstrapping keys is also reduced with this contribution by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.7."

    "abstract": "The Lightning Network, a payment channel network with a market cap of over 192M USD, is designed to resolve Bitcoin's scalability issues through fast off-chain transactions. There are multiple Lightning Network client implementations, all of which conform to the same textual specifications known as BOLTs. Several vulnerabilities have been manually discovered, but to-date there have been few works systematically analyzing the security of the Lightning Network.In this work, we take a foundational approach to analyzing the security of the Lightning Network with the help of formal methods. Based on the BOLTs' specifications, we build a detailed formal model of the Lightning Network's single-hop payment protocol and verify it using the Spin model checker. Our model captures both concurrency and error semantics of the payment protocol. We then define several security properties which capture the correct intermediate operation of the protocol, ensuring that the outcome is always certain to both channel peers, and using them we re-discover a known attack previously reported in the literature along with a novel attack, referred to as a Payout Race. A Payout Race consists of a particular sequence of events that can lead to an ambiguity in the protocol in which innocent users can unwittingly lose funds. We confirm the practicality of this attack by reproducing it in a local testbed environment."

As a dominant implementation, Arbitrum has boasted a total locked value exceeding 18 billion USD, highlighting the significance of optimistic rollups in blockchain ecosystem. Despite their popularity, little research has been done on the security of optimistic rollup protocols, and potential vulnerabilities on them remain unknown.In this work, we unveil three novel double spending attacks on Arbitrum, each enabling an attacker to steal funds from cross-chain applications on Arbitrum. To facilitate these double spending attacks, we introduce an attack to induce manipulable delays in the transaction rollup process and propose a cost optimization solution to reduce further transaction fees associated with the attacks. Our investigations broaden the exploitation of our double spending attacks to another leading optimistic rollup protocol, Optimism, highlighting the generability of our proposed attacks. Through extensive experiments on a local test network, we demonstrated that our attacks lead to severe malicious effects, such as fund losses from double spending. From late 2022 to early 2023, we reported these vulnerabilities to the Arbitrum and Optimism teams. All the issues were acknowledged and resolved, and our research safeguarded billions of dollars at risk, earning us half a million dollars in bug bounty rewards."

    "abstract": "The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging.In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks."

    "abstract": "Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration."

    "abstract": "Regular access to unpredictable and bias-resistant randomness is important for applications such as blockchains, voting, and secure distributed computing. Distributed random beacon protocols address this need by distributing trust across multiple nodes, with the majority of them assumed to be honest. Numerous applications across the blockchain space have led to the proposal of several distributed random beacon protocols, with some already implemented. However, many current random beacon systems rely on threshold cryptographic setups or exhibit high computational costs, while others expect the network to be partial or bounded synchronous. To overcome these limitations, we propose HashRand, a computation and communication-efficient asynchronous random beacon protocol that only demands secure hash and pairwise secure channels to generate beacons. HashRand has a per-node amortized communication complexity of O (λn log(n)) bits per beacon. The computational efficiency of HashRand is attributed to the two orders of magnitude lower time of a one-way Hash computation compared to discrete log exponentiation. Interestingly, besides reduced overhead, HashRand achieves Post-Quantum security by leveraging the secure Hash function against quantum adversaries, setting it apart from other random beacon protocols that use discrete log cryptography. In a geo-distributed testbed of n = 136 nodes, HashRand produces 78 beacons per minute, which is at least 5\\texttimes{} higher than Spurt [IEEE S&amp;P'22]. We also demonstrate the practical utility of HashRand by implementing a Post-Quantum secure Asynchronous SMR protocol, which has a response rate of over 135k transactions per second at a latency of 2.3 seconds over a WAN for n = 16 nodes."

While efforts have been made to improve DKG communication, practical large-scale deployments are still yet to come due to various challenges, including the heavy overhead (particularly broadcast) in adversarial cases. In this paper, we propose a practical DKG for DLog-based cryptosystems, which achieves (quasi-)linear computation and communication per-node cost with the help of a common coin, even in the face of the maximal amount of Byzantine nodes. Moreover, our protocol is secure against adaptive adversaries, which can corrupt less than half of all nodes. The key to our improvements lies in delegating the most costly operations to an Any-Trust group together with a set of techniques for adaptive security. Moreover, we present a generic transformer that enables us to efficiently deploy a conventional distributed protocol like our DKG, even when the participants have different weights.Our DKG leads to a fully practical instantiation of Filecoin's checkpointing mechanism, in which all validators of a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain periodically run DKG and threshold signing to create checkpoints on Bitcoin, to enhance the security of the PoS chain. In comparison with the recent checkpointing approach of Babylon (Oakland, 2023), ours enjoys a significantly smaller cost of Bitcoin transaction fees. For 212 validators, our cost is merely 0.4\\% of that incurred by Babylon's approach."

We gathered search terms from n=30 awareness professionals to perform an automated Google search and scraping of SAT vendors' websites. We then performed a thematic analysis of 2,476 statements on 156 websites from 59 vendors. We found that the messaging from SAT vendors precisely targets customers' need for easy-to-implement and compliance-fulfilling SAT products; how SAT products are offered also means that some of the impacts of SAT go unmentioned and are transferred to the customer, such as user support. In this vendor-customer relationship, employees are portrayed as a source of weaknesses, needing an indefinite amount of training to be incorporated into the organization's protection. We conclude with suggestions for SAT vendors and regulators, notably toward an SAT ecosystem that directly links SAT solutions to usable security technologies within the organization environment."

This shift also came with significant discontent from students who took to online platforms to both express their displeasure with remote proctoring and the methods they used for evading monitoring methods, essentially discussing _hacks_ to subvert the software and cheat on exams. In this paper, we seek to understand both the methods this online community shares for evading online proctoring and why they do so. Through qualitative analysis of social media videos (n=137) and comments (n=4,297) on YouTube and TikTok, we find both non-technical (e.g., sticky-notes) and deeply technical (e.g., custom virtual machines) methods of evading proctoring. The online videos, as well as the active comment sections, provide an important window into both an (unethical) desire to cheat but also the development of a security mindset. Many see proctoring software as invasive surveillance technology, and the discussion and sharing of methods to subvert it have similar tones to that of the hacker/tinkerer communities who also seek to share their experiences of subverting technology, for fun and profit. We conclude with lessons for the security and privacy community about evading online exam proctoring, as well as a conversation about fairness and equity in proctoring design."

In response to this, the research community has developed a wide array of detection techniques aimed at preventing such attacks from deceiving users. Unfortunately, the creation of these defenses has generally overlooked the most important element of the system - the user themselves. As such, it is not clear whether current mechanisms augment, hinder, or simply contradict human classification of deepfakes. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale user study on deepfake detection. We recruit over 1,200 users and present them with samples from the three most widely-cited deepfake datasets. We then quantitatively compare performance and qualitatively conduct thematic analysis to motivate and understand the reasoning behind user decisions and differences from machine classifications. Our results show that users correctly classify human audio at significantly higher rates than machine learning models, and rely on linguistic features and intuition when performing classification. However, users are also regularly misled by pre-conceptions about the capabilities of generated audio (e.g., that accents and background sounds are indicative of humans). Finally, machine learning models suffer from significantly higher false positive rates, and experience false negatives that humans correctly classify when issues of quality or robotic characteristics are reported. By analyzing user behavior across multiple deepfake datasets, our study demonstrates the need to more tightly compare user and machine learning performance, and to target the latter towards areas where humans are less likely to successfully identify threats."

We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with software professionals, including software engineers, team leads, and security testers. We also reviewed 190 relevant Reddit posts and comments to gain insights into the current discourse surrounding AI assistants for software development. Our analysis of the interviews and Reddit posts finds that, despite many security and quality concerns, participants widely use AI assistants for security-critical tasks, e.g., code generation, threat modeling, and vulnerability detection. Participants' overall mistrust leads to checking AI suggestions in similar ways to human code. However, they expect improvements and, therefore, a heavier use of AI for security tasks in the future. We conclude with recommendations for software professionals to critically check AI suggestions, for AI creators to improve suggestion security and capabilities for ethical security tasks, and for academic researchers to consider general-purpose AI in software development."

    "abstract": "Microarchitectural security verification of software has seen the emergence of two broad classes of approaches. The first uses non-interference-based semantic security properties which are verified for a given program and a given model of the hardware microarchitecture. The second is based on attack patterns, which, if found in a program execution, indicates the presence of an exploit. We observe that while the former uses a formal specification that can capture several gadget variants targeting the same vulnerability, it is limited by the scalability of verification. While more scalable, patterns must be currently constructed manually, as they are narrower in scope and sensitive to gadget-specific structure.This work develops a technique that, given a non-interference-based semantic security hyperproperty, automatically generates attack patterns up to a certain complexity parameter (called the skeleton size). Thus, we combine the advantages of both approaches: security can be specified by a hyperproperty that uniformly captures several gadget variants, while automatically generated patterns can be used for scalable verification. We implement our approach in a tool and demonstrate the ability to generate new patterns, (e.g., for SpectreV1, SpectreV4) and improved scalability using the generated patterns over hyperproperty-based verification."

The security models we consider are (S)PRP, and strengthenings thereof under related-key (RK), key-dependent message (KD), and more generally key-correlated (KC) attacks.Using AlgoROM, we are able to reconfirm a number of classical and previously established security theorems, and in one case we identify a gap in a proof from the literature (Connolly et al., ToSC'19). However, most results that we prove with AlgoROM are new. In particular, we obtain new positive results for LR, KAF, EM, and SPN in the above models. Our results better reflect the configurations actually implemented in practice, as they use a single idealized primitive. In contrast to many existing tools, our automated proofs do not operate in symbolic models, but rather in the standard probabilistic model for cryptography."

The produced NASM is recompilable, and we extensively test the recompiled binaries to see if they exhibit the same behavior as the original ones. In addition to testing, the produced NASM is accompanied with a certificate, constructed in such a way that if all theorems in the certificate hold, symbolization has occurred correctly. The original and recompiled binary are lifted again with a third-party decompiler (Ghidra). These representations, as well as the certificate, are loaded into the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, where proof scripts ensure that correctness can be proven automatically. We have applied symbolization to various stripped binaries from various sources, from various compilers, and ranging over various optimization levels.

We then algebraically characterize these requirements for microarchitectural components that are indexed by linear functions, which is the prevalent case in today's CPUs. Based on this, we develop efficient algorithms for computing multi-resource coloring schemes from linear indexing functions, and for reverse-engineering unknown linear indexing functions under minimal assumptions.In a case study, we use our algorithms to compute coloring schemes for recent Intel CPUs, and we show how to design indexing functions that maximize the number of supported trust domains."

Unfortunately, these axioms are complex to design and implement; so far, these tasks are manual, ad-hoc and error-prone. We solve these issues by providing a formal and systematic method for deriving axioms from cryptographic games. Our method relies on synthesizing an adversary against some cryptographic game, through the notion of bi-deduction.

FL for non-graph data has shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject a shared backdoor trigger into the training data such that the trained backdoored FL model can predict the testing data containing the trigger as the attacker desires. However, FedGL against backdoor attacks is largely unexplored, and no effective defense exists.In this paper, we aim to address such significant deficiency. First, we propose an effective, stealthy, and persistent backdoor attack on FedGL. Our attack uses a subgraph as the trigger and designs an adaptive trigger generator that can derive the effective trigger location and shape for each graph. Our attack shows that empirical defenses are hard to detect/remove our generated triggers. To mitigate it, we further develop a certified defense for any backdoored FedGL model against the trigger with any shape at any location. Our defense involves carefully dividing a testing graph into multiple subgraphs and designing a majority vote-based ensemble classifier on these subgraphs. We then derive the deterministic certified robustness based on the ensemble classifier and prove its tightness. We extensively evaluate our attack and defense on six graph datasets. Our attack results show our attack can obtain &gt;90\\% backdoor accuracy in almost all datasets. Our defense results show, in certain cases, the certified accuracy for clean testing graphs against an arbitrary trigger with size 20 can be close to the normal accuracy under no attack, while there is a moderate gap in other cases.

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) facilitates the preservation of privacy in federated learning (FL) aggregation. However, HE imposes significant computational and communication overhead. To address this problem, data encoding methods have been introduced that enable batch processing to improving the efficiency of ciphertext usage. The existing methods simply concatenate integer or coefficients assignment in polynomials, which do not fully make use of HE based on ring learning with errors (RLWE). We present a novel two-tier data encoding approach tailored for RLWE-based HE, effectively utilizing RLWE's polynomial structure. Our method involves a dual-level data packing strategy for batch processing at both integer and polynomial levels. At the first tier (integer level), we amalgamate those quantized model data into larger integers. Beyond existing concatenation-based encoding, we introduce a new encoding method derived from the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). This CRT-based method effectively mitigates overflow and error propagation concerns. At the second tier (polynomial level), we transmute the large integers into a polynomial form. Additionally, we propose a new subring decomposition method, i.e., employing ring isomorphism mappings to project multiple large integers into varied sub-polynomial rings. Our dual-tier encoding strategy offers a more flexible and effective batch HE solution. We rigorously analyze the correctness, efficiency, and security of our approach. Our extensive experimental evaluations reveal that secure FL, empowered by our dual-tier encoding technique, markedly enhances computational and communication efficiencies over prevailing batch HE methods."

Locally differentially private algorithms require little trust but are (provably) limited in their utility. Centrally differentially private algorithms can allow significantly better utility but require a trusted curator. This gap has led to significant interest in the design and implementation of simple cryptographic primitives, that can allow central-like utility guarantees without having to trust a central server.Our first contribution is to propose a new primitive that allows for efficient implementation of several commonly used algorithms, and allows for privacy accounting that is close to that in the central setting without requiring the strong trust assumptions it entails. Shuffling and aggregation primitives that have been proposed in earlier works enable this for some algorithms, but have significant limitations as primitives. We propose a Samplable Anonymous Aggregation primitive, which computes an aggregate over a random subset of the inputs and show that it leads to better privacy-utility trade-offs for various fundamental tasks. Secondly, we propose a system architecture that implements this primitive and perform a security analysis of the proposed system. Our design combines additive secret-sharing with anonymization and authentication infrastructures."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without revealing their private training data. In conventional FL, the system follows the server-assisted architecture (server-assisted FL), where the training process is coordinated by a central server. However, the server-assisted FL framework suffers from poor scalability due to a communication bottleneck at the server, and trust dependency issues. To address challenges, decentralized federated learning (DFL) architecture has been proposed to allow clients to train models collaboratively in a serverless and peer-to-peer manner. However, due to its fully decentralized nature, DFL is highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients could manipulate the system by sending carefully-crafted local models to their neighboring clients. To date, only a limited number of Byzantine-robust DFL methods have been proposed, most of which are either communication-inefficient or remain vulnerable to advanced poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called BALANCE (&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;yzantine-robust &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;veraging through &lt;u&gt;l&lt;/u&gt;ocal simil&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;rity i&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt; de&lt;u&gt;ce&lt;/u&gt;ntralization) to defend against poisoning attacks in DFL. In BALANCE, each client leverages its own local model as a similarity reference to determine if the received model is malicious or benign. We establish the theoretical convergence guarantee for BALANCE under poisoning attacks in both strongly convex and non-convex settings. Furthermore, the convergence rate of BALANCE under poisoning attacks matches those of the state-of-the-art counterparts in Byzantine-free settings. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that BALANCE outperforms existing DFL methods and effectively defends against poisoning attacks."

Despite its privacy advantages, FR remains vulnerable to poisoning attacks. We focus on untargeted poisoning attacks against FR which degrade the overall performance of recommender services, leading to a detrimental impact on user experience and service quality. In this paper, we propose a general framework to formalise untargeted attacks and identify the vital role played by the interplay between items and user profiles in determining FR's performance. We present an untargeted attack FRecAttack2 which exploits this interplay. Specifically, we develop various methods for sampling user profiles, which approximate user distributions with and without collusion among malicious users. Then we leverage a new measurement to identify items that can disrupt the original interplay with user profiles, based on the change velocity of items' recommendation scores during optimisation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our attack, outperforming existing methods by up to 27.56\\%, and its stealthiness in evading mainstream defences. To counteract untargeted attacks, we present a defence GuardCQ to detect malicious users by quantifying their contribution to boost the right interplay between items and user profiles. Empirical results show that GuardCQ effectively mitigates the attack's impact on FR and enhances the robustness of FR against poisoning attacks."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced various domains. Adapting these models for specific tasks often involves fine-tuning (FT) with private, domain-specific data. However, privacy concerns keep this data undisclosed, and the computational demands for deploying LLMs pose challenges for resource-limited data holders. This has sparked interest in split learning (SL), a Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm that divides LLMs into smaller segments for distributed training and deployment, transmitting only intermediate activations instead of raw data. SL has garnered substantial interest in both industry and academia as it aims to balance user data privacy, model ownership, and resource challenges in the private fine-tuning of LLMs. Despite its privacy claims, this paper reveals significant vulnerabilities arising from the combination of SL and LLM-FT: the Not-too-far property of fine-tuning and the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose Bidirectional Semi-white-box Reconstruction (BiSR), the first data reconstruction attack (DRA) designed to target both the forward and backward propagation processes of SL. BiSR utilizes pre-trained weights as prior knowledge, combining a learning-based attack with a bidirectional optimization-based approach for highly effective data reconstruction. Additionally, it incorporates a Noise-adaptive Mixture of Experts (NaMoE) model to enhance reconstruction performance under perturbation. We conducted systematic experiments on various mainstream LLMs and different setups, empirically demonstrating BiSR's state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we thoroughly examined three representative defense mechanisms, showcasing our method's capability to reconstruct private data even in the presence of these defenses."

As a typical data-only attack, memory corruption attacks can compromise the integrity of kernel data, which effectively breaks the premises of access control systems. Unfortunately, the prevalence of memory corruption vulnerabilities allows attackers to exploit them and bypass access control mechanisms. Given the arbitrary memory access capability, attackers can overwrite access control policies or illegally access the kernel resources protected by the access control systems.This paper presents PeTAL, a practical access control integrity solution against data-only attacks on the ARM-based Linux kernel. PeTAL is designed to ensure access control integrity by providing policy integrity and complete enforcement of access control systems. PeTAL first identifies kernel data used as access control policies and kernel data protected by access control policies, based on the user interfaces of the Linux kernel. Then, PeTAL leverages the ARM Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) and Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to comprehensively protect the integrity of the identified kernel data and pointers. We implemented the prototype of PeTAL and evaluated the performance and the security impact of PeTAL on real AArch64 hardware with PAC and MTE support. Our evaluation results show that PeTAL can effectively thwart memory-corruption-based attacks on access control systems with reasonable performance overheads at most 4\\% on average in user applications, demonstrating its efficient prospects for kernel security"

These protocols establish a structured framework for verifying and authenticating the identities of individuals, organizations, and devices, while avoiding the necessity of sharing sensitive credentials (e.g., passwords) with external entities. However, the security guarantees of these protocols rely on their proper implementation, and real-world implementations can, and indeed often do, contain logical programming errors leading to severe attacks, including authentication bypass and user account takeover. In response to this challenge, we present AuthSaber, an automated verifier designed to assess the real-world OIDC protocol implementations against their standard safety specifications in a scalable manner. AuthSaber addresses the challenges of expressiveness for OIDC properties, modeling multi-party interactions, and automation by first designing a novel specification language based on linear temporal logic, leveraging an automaton-based approach to constrain the space of possible interactions between OIDC entities, and incorporating several domain-specific transformations to obtain programs and properties that can be directly reasoned about by software model checkers.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the growth of mobile advertising has been driven by in-app programmatic advertising and technologies like Real-Time Bidding (RTB). However, this growth has also led to an increase in ad fraud, such as click injection, background ad activity, etc. While existing studies have primarily concentrated on ad fraud within individual apps or devices, this paper introduces a new form of collusion-based ad fraud, named ad attribution laundering fraud (ALF). ALF involves multiple apps collaborating to deceive advertisers by misrepresenting the app where ads are displayed. The collusion-based approach allows lower-quality apps to exploit the reputable identities of seemingly legitimate apps. This deceives advertisers or ad networks into believing that the advertisements they place are reaching potentially valid end-users on the legitimate app. The seemingly legitimate ad events and ad attribution procedures employed by individual apps in such attacks can evade detection by existing tools.To detect ALF, we design and implement the first detection framework, AlfScan. It overcomes two challenges to extract apps' identities from diverse and obfuscated apps using both static and dynamic analysis techniques, then cross-check the identities to identify ALF. We evaluate AlfScan on a 200-app ground truth dataset, and it achieves 92\\% precision and 92\\% recall. We use AlfScan to conduct a large-scale analysis on 91, 006 apps and identify 4, 515 unique fraudulent apps and 1, 483 fraudulent clusters, exposing patterns among fraudulent developers and revealing reliability issues in third-party app development frameworks. We also find that through ALF, fraudulent apps can generate invalid ad traffic that is 2.43 times to 33.33 greater than the ad traffic they would normally generate. After reporting our findings to 15 ad network companies, 4 companies expressed interest in testing AlfScan. In particular, we have submitted 344 apps to the Unity ad team, and they have confirmed that the apps were involved in fraudulent activities."

Furthermore, as these tools are primarily aimed at non-Go languages, they have limited applicability and accuracy in the Go ecosystem, which is extensively used for security-centric applications. To mitigate these challenges, we present Gopher, a novel cryptographic misuse detection framework, that excels in encapsulated API and cross-library detection.

Diverse and powerful attacks threaten data confidentiality. Memory safety is notoriously hard to achieve with unsafe languages, thereby empowering adversaries with unauthorized memory accesses, as represented by the HeartBleed incident. More recently, microarchitectural side channel attacks reign as a prevalent threat against data confidentiality that affects program execution including the safeguarded ones inside TEEs.In this paper, we introduce an in-process memory subsystem called uMMU. uMMU coherently consolidates the notion of employing processor registers as unobservable storage with data confidentiality protection techniques such as memory encryption and Oblivious RAM. uMMU creates a new address space called uVirtual address space that is unobservable to adversaries. Under the abstraction created by uMMU, the processor's spacious extended registers, such as Intel x86's AVX512, are transformed into unobservable and addressable physical memory backing. Completing the principles of virtual memory abstraction is the memory management that maintains a secure swap space applied with memory confidentiality policies such as encryption or ORAM. uMMU is a versatile and powerful framework that can host data confidentiality policies on sensitive data. Our real-world evaluation indicates that uMMU significantly improves the performance of programs with encryption and ORAM schemes for sensitive data protection: an average of 69.93\\% improvement in encryption-based protection of sensitive data in MbedTLS, and 497.84\\% for ORAM-based elimination of access patterns on Memcached's hashtable."

In this work, we systematize the requirements of MHE-based MPC protocols from a practical lens, and we propose a novel execution mechanism that addresses those considerations. We implement this execution mechanism in Helium, which makes it the first implemented framework to support MPC under network churn based solely on cryptographic assumptions. We show that a Helium network of 30 parties connected with 100Mbits/s links and experiencing a system-wide churn rate of 40 failures per minute can compute the product between a fixed 512x512 secret matrix (e.g., a collectively-trained private model) and a fresh secret vector (e.g., a feature vector) 8.3 times per second.

    "abstract": "Threshold secret sharing enables distributing a message to n parties such that no subset of fewer than t parties can learn the message, whereas any subset of at least t parties can recover the message. Despite being a fundamental primitive, secret sharing still suffers from one significant drawback, where its message reconstruction algorithm is computationally expensive for large privacy thresholds t. In this paper, we aim to address this significant drawback.We study general (t,c)-ramp secret sharing schemes where the number of parties c needed to reconstruct the secret may be larger than t. We present a ramp secret sharing scheme whose reconstruction time is 2-7.8x faster than prior constructions suitable against adversaries that adaptively corrupt parties. For t = 220, our new protocol has reconstruction time of 5 seconds whereas prior work requires nearly half a minute. We see improvements starting from as small as t = 256. Furthermore, we obtain correctness threshold as small as c ≥ 1.05t. To obtain our construction, we first improve the secret sharing frameworks by Cramer et al. (EUROCRYPT'15) and Applebaum et al. (CRYPTO'23) from erasure codes. Our new framework obtains secret sharing schemes that may be used against adversaries with adaptive corruptions while requiring only weaker correctness guarantees from the underlying erasure code with a distributed generation property. Furthermore, our new framework also maintains the linear homomorphism of the prior works. Afterwards, we present a concretely efficient erasure code from random band matrices that satisfies the distributed generation property.We show that our secret sharing scheme can improve many real-world applications. In secure aggregation protocols for federated learning, we obtain up to 22\\% reductions in computational cost by replacing Shamir's scheme with our construction. We extend our protocol to obtain a verifiable ramp secret sharing scheme where each party can verify the consistency of the shares. Our new verifiable ramp secret sharing has 8.2-25.2x faster sharing and 2.7-23.2x faster reconstruction time compared to prior works.

We adapt existing tree-based ORAM to obtain an oblivious SAM (OSAM) that has O(log n) bandwidth blow-up (which we show is optimal), small client storage, and a single roundtrip.OSAM unlocks improvements to oblivious data structures/algorithms. For instance, we achieve oblivious unbalanced binary trees (e.g. tries, splay trees). By leveraging splay trees, we obtain a notion of caching ORAM, where an access in the worst case incurs amortized O(log2 n) bandwidth blow-up and O(log n) roundtrips, but in many common cases (e.g. sequential scans) incurs only amortized O(log n) bandwidth blow-up and O(1) roundtrips. We also give new oblivious graph algorithms, including computing minimum spanning trees and single source shortest paths, in which the OSAM client reads/writes O(|E| ⋅ log |E|) words using O(|E|) roundtrips, where |E| is the number of edges. This improves over prior custom solutions by a log factor.At a higher level, OSAM provides a general model for oblivious computation. We construct a programming interface around OSAM that supports arbitrary pointer-manipulating programs such that dereferencing a pointer to an object incurs O(log d log n) bandwidth blowup and O(log d) roundtrips, where d is the number of pointers to that object. This new interface captures a wide variety of data structures and algorithms (e.g., trees, tries, doubly-linked lists) while matching or exceeding prior best asymptotic results. It both unifies much of our understanding of oblivious computation and allows the programmer to write oblivious algorithms combining various common data structures/algorithms and beyond."

    "abstract": "We explore Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) of statements expressed as programs written in high-level languages, e.g., C or assembly. At the core of executing such programs in ZK is the repeated evaluation of a CPU step, achieved by branching over the CPU's instruction set. This approach is general and covers traversal-execution of a program's control flow graph (CFG): here CPU instructions are straight-line program fragments (of various sizes) associated with the CFG nodes. This highlights the usefulness of ZK CPUs with a large number of instructions of varying sizes.We formalize and design an efficient tight ZK CPU, where the cost (both computation and communication, for each party) of each step depends only on the instruction taken. This qualitatively improves over state of the art, where cost scales with the size of the largest CPU instruction (largest CFG node).Our technique is formalized in the standard commit-and-prove paradigm, so our results are compatible with a variety of (interactive and non-interactive) general-purpose ZK.We implemented an interactive tight arithmetic (over F261-1) ZK CPU based on Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) and compared it to the state-of-the-art non-tight VOLE-based ZK CPU Batchman (Yang et al. CCS'23). In our experiments, under the same hardware configuration, we achieve comparable performance when instructions are of the same size and a 5-18\\texttimes{} improvement when instructions are of varied size. Our VOLE-based tight ZK CPU (over F261-1) can execute 100K (resp. 450K) multiplication gates per second in a WAN-like (resp. LAN-like) setting. It requires ≤ 102 Bytes per multiplication gate. Our basic building block, ZK Unbalanced Read-Only Memory, may be of independent interest."

    "abstract": "Space-efficient SNARKs aim to reduce the prover's space overhead which is one the main obstacles for deploying SNARKs in practice, as it can be prohibitively large (e.g., orders of magnitude larger than natively performing the computation). In this work, we propose Sparrow, a novel space-efficient zero-knowledge SNARK for data-parallel arithmetic circuits with two attractive features: (i) it is the first space-efficient scheme where, for a given field, the prover overhead increases with a multiplicative sublogarithmic factor as the circuit size increases, and (ii) compared to prior space-efficient SNARKs that work for arbitrary arithmetic circuits, it achieves prover space asymptotically smaller than the circuit size itself. Our key building block is a novel space-efficient sumcheck argument with improved prover time which may be of independent interest. Our experimental results for three use cases (arbitrary data parallel circuits, multiplication trees, batch SHA256 hashing) indicate Sparrow outperforms the prior state-of-the-art space-efficient SNARK for arithmetic circuits Gemini (Bootle et al., EUROCRYPT'22) by 3.2-28.7x in total prover space and 3.1-11.3x in prover time. We then use Sparrow to build zero-knowledge proofs of tree training and prediction, relying on its space efficiency to scale to large datasets and forests of multiple trees. Compared to a (non-space-efficient) optimal-time SNARK based on the GKR protocol, we observe prover space reduction of 16-240x for tree training while maintaining essentially the same prover and verifier times and proof size. Even more interestingly, our prover requires comparable space to natively perform the underlying computation. E.g., for a 400MB dataset, our prover only needs 1.4x more space than the native computation."

    "abstract": "The hardness of lattice problems offers one of the most promising security foundations for quantum-safe cryptography. Basic schemes for public key encryption and digital signatures are already close to standardization at NIST and several other standardization bodies, and the research frontier has moved on to building primitives with more advanced privacy features. At the core of many such primitives are zero-knowledge proofs. In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs for (and using) lattice relations have seen a dramatic jump in efficiency and they currently provide arguably the shortest, and most computationally efficient, quantum-safe proofs for many scenarios. The main difficulty in using these proofs by non-experts (and experts!) is that they have a lot of moving parts and a lot of internal parameters depend on the particular instance that one is trying to prove.Our main contribution is a library for zero-knowledge and succinct proofs which consists of efficient and flexible C code underneath a simple-to-use Python interface. Users without any background in lattice-based proofs should be able to specify the lattice relations and the norm bounds that they would like to prove and the library will automatically create a proof system, complete with the intrinsic parameters, using either the succinct proofs of LaBRADOR (Beullens and Seiler, Crypto 2023) or the linear-size, though smaller for certain application, proofs of Lyubashevsky et al. (Crypto 2022). The Python interface also allows for common operations used in lattice-based cryptography which will enable users to write and prototype their full protocols within the syntactically simple Python environment.We showcase some of the library's usefulness by giving protocol implementations for blind signatures, anonymous credentials, the zero-knowledge proof needed in the recent Swoosh protocol (Gajland et al., Usenix 2024), proving knowledge of Kyber keys, and an aggregate signature scheme. Most of these are the most efficient, from a size, speed, and memory perspective, known quantum-safe instantiations."

In this work, we study sufficient and necessary conditions for constructing simulation-extractable universal zkSNARKs via the popular design approach based on compiling polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOP). Our main result is the first security proof that popular universal zkSNARKs, such as PLONK and Marlin, as deployed in the real world, are simulation-extractable. Our result fills a gap left from previous work (Faonio et al. TCC'23, and Kohlweiss et al.

Range proofs find extensive application in various domains. However, the efficiency of many existing schemes diminishes significantly when confronted with batch proofs encompassing multiple elements.To improve the scalability and efficiency, we propose MissileProof, a vector range proof scheme, proving that every element in the committed vector is within [0,2n). We first reduce this argument to a bi-to-univariate SumCheck problem and a bivariate polynomial ZeroTest problem. Then generalizing the idea of univariate SumCheck PIOP, we design a bi-to-univariate SumCheck PIOP. By introducing a random polynomial, we construct the bivariate polynomial ZeroTest using a univariate polynomial ZeroTest and a univariate polynomial SumCheck PIOP. Finally, combining the PIOP for vector range proof, a KZG-based polynomial commitment scheme and the Fiat-Shamir transformation, we get a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive vector range proof.Compared with existing schemes, our scheme has the optimal proof size (O(1)), the optimal commitment length (O(1)), and the optimal verification time (O(1)), at the expense of slightly sacrificing proof time (O(log l ⋅ n log n) operations on the prime field for FFT and O(ln) group exponentiations in G). Moreover, we implemented an anti-money-laundering stateless blockchain based on the MissileProof. The gas consumption of the verification smart contract is reduced by 85\\%."

By simply relying on mildly stronger security assumptions, LUNA is also a candidate ZK-SNARK (i.e. argument of knowledge). LUNA achieves significant improvements in concrete proof sizes, reaching below 6 KB (compared to &gt;32 KB in prior work) for 128-bit security/privacy level. To achieve our quasi-optimal succinct LUNA, we give a new regularity result for 'private' re-randomization of Module LWE (MLWE) samples using discrete Gaussian randomization vectors, also known as a lattice-based leftover hash lemma with leakage, which applies with a discrete Gaussian re-randomization parameter that is polynomial in the statistical privacy parameter (avoiding exponential smudging), and hides the coset of the re-randomization vector support set. Along the way, we derive bounds on the smoothing parameter of the intersection of short integer solution (SIS), gadget, and Gaussian perp module lattices over the power of 2 cyclotomic rings. We then introduce a new candidate linear-only homomorphic encryption scheme called Module Half-GSW (HGSW), and apply our regularity theorem to provide smudging-free circuit-private homomorphic linear operations for Module HGSW. Our implementation and experimental performance evaluation show that, for typical instance sizes, Module HGSW provides favourable performance for ZK-SNARG applications involving lightweight verifiers. It enables significantly (around 5x) shorter proof lengths while speeding up CRS generation and encryption time by 4-16x and speeding up decryption time by 4.3x, while incurring just 1.2-2x time overhead in linear homomorphic proof generation operations, compared to a Regev encryption used in prior work in the ZK-SNARG context.

Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications.We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts.zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. Unlike prior works, zkLogin's security relies solely on the underlying platform's authentication mechanism without the need for any additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles). As the name suggests, zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the sensitive link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself.zkLogin enables a number of important applications outside blockchains. It allows billions of users to produce verifiable digital content leveraging their existing digital identities, e.g., email address. For example, a journalist can use zkLogin to sign a news article with their email address, allowing verification of the article's authorship by any party.We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an additional alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. Due to the ease of web3 on-boarding just with social login, many hundreds of thousands of zkLogin accounts have already been generated in various industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT collections, sports racing, cultural heritage, and many more."

Clients may later withdraw from the pool without linkage to previous deposits. Some privacy pools also support hidden transfer of currency ownership within the pool. In August 2022, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, the largest Ethereum privacy pool, on the premise that it enables illicit actors to hide the origin of funds, citing its usage by the DPRK-sponsored Lazarus Group to launder over $455 million dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency. This ruling effectively made it illegal for U.S. persons/institutions to use or accept funds that went through Tornado Cash, sparking a global debate among privacy rights activists and lawmakers. Against this backdrop, we present Derecho, a system that institutions could use to request cryptographic attestations of fund origins rather than naively rejecting all funds coming from privacy pools. Derecho is a novel application of proof-carrying data, which allows users to propagate allowlist membership proofs through a privacy pool's transaction graph. Derecho is backwards-compatible with existing Ethereum privacy pool designs, adds no overhead in gas costs, and costs users only a few seconds to produce attestations."

It achieves its privacy goals through an unlinkable handshake mechanism built on top of an identity-based non-interactive key exchange. By leveraging a custom distributed architecture, Arke forgoes the expense of consensus to achieve scalability while maintaining consistency in an adversarial environment. Performance evaluations demonstrate that Arke provides a throughput of over 1,500 user requests per second at a latency of less than 0.5 seconds in a large geo-distributed setting which would allow privacy-preserving contact discovery for all of the popular messaging applications in one system."

We put forth a new definition for a cryptographic scheme that we name verifiable encryption under committed key (VECK), and we propose two instantiations for this scheme. Our protocol relies on a blockchain to enforce the atomicity of the exchange and uses VECK to ensure that the client receives the correct data (matching an agreed-upon commitment) before releasing the payment for the decrypting key. Our protocol is trust-minimized and requires only constant-sized on-chain communication, concretely 3 signatures, 1 verification key, and 1 secret key, with most of the data stored and communicated off-chain. It also supports exchanging only a subset of the data, can amortize the server's work across multiple clients, and offers a general framework to design alternative FDE protocols using different commitment schemes. A prominent application of our protocol is the Danksharding data availability scheme on Ethereum, which commits to data via KZG polynomial commitments. We also provide an open-source implementation for our protocol with both instantiations for VECK, demonstrating our protocol's efficiency and practicality on Ethereum."

We give an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol whose security is only based on cryptographic hash functions modeled as a random oracle. Our protocol has O(κn3) total communication and runs in expected O(1) rounds. The fact that we use only cryptographic hash functions also means that our protocol is post-quantum secure. The minimal use of cryptography and the small number of rounds make our protocol practical. We implement our protocol and evaluate it in a geo-distributed setting with up to 128 machines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol is more efficient than the only other setup-free consensus protocol that has been implemented to date.

Given credentials' fault probabilities (e.g., loss or leak), we seek mechanisms with maximal success probability. Such analysis was not possible before due to the large number of possible mechanisms. We show that every mechanism is dominated by some Boolean mechanism ---defined by a monotonic Boolean function on presented credentials. We present an algorithm for finding approximately optimal mechanisms by leveraging the problem structure to reduce complexity by orders of magnitude.The algorithm immediately revealed two surprising results: Accurately incorporating easily-lost credentials improves cryptocurrency wallet security by orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "IoT firmware faces severe threats to security vulnerabilities. As an important method to detect vulnerabilities, recurring vulnerability detection has not been systematically studied in IoT firmware. In fact, existing methods would meet significant challenges from two aspects. First, firmware vulnerabilities are usually reported in texts without too much code-level information, e.g., security patches. Second, firmware images are released as binaries, making the analysis of known vulnerabilities and the detection of unknown vulnerabilities quite difficult. This paper presents FirmRec, the first recurring vulnerability detection approach for IoT firmware. FirmRec features several new techniques to enable accurate and efficient vulnerability detection.First, it proposes a new exploitation-based vulnerability signature representation for firmware, which does not use syntactic code features but the semantic features along the dynamic vulnerability exploitation procedure (thus is more resilient to binary code changes and fits the context of binary-only firmware). Second, given a vulnerability report, it designs concolic execution-based vulnerability signature extraction to understand the vulnerability exploitation procedure and generate an exploitation-based vulnerability signature. Third, based on known vulnerability signatures, it employs a two-stage pipeline to accurately and efficiently detect recurring vulnerabilities. With a dataset of 320 firmware images, FirmRec efficiently detects 642 vulnerabilities. Till now, 53 CVEs have been assigned. Compared with SaTC, jTrans, and Greenhouse, FirmRec detects more vulnerabilities and is more accurate. Our study shows that recurring vulnerabilities are quite prevalent in IoT firmware but require new techniques to detect."

To ensure the effectiveness of RISiren, we propose a novel metasurface configuration strategy aiming at creating human-like activities that stem from a comprehensive analysis of how human activities impact wireless signal propagation. We have implemented and validated RISiren using commercial Wi-Fi devices.

In this paper, we propose a novel physical adversarial attack against deep face recognition systems, namely Agile (Adversarial Glasses with Infrared LasEr). It generates adjustable, invisible laser perturbations and emits them into the camera CMOS to launch dodging and impersonation attacks against facial biometrics systems. To do so, we first theoretically model physical adversarial perturbations and convert them to the digital domain. The generated synthesized attack signals are utilized to guide real-world laser settings. Our experiments with real-world attackers and a benchmark face database show that Agile is highly effective in DoS, dodging, and impersonation attacks. More importantly, the candidate impersonation target and optimal attack settings identified by Agile's attack synthesis approach are highly consistent with real-world physical attack results.

To refute this false belief, we propose RefleXnoop, enabling an attacker to snoop a victim's typing details on a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) laptop. Apart from passively overhearing keystroke acoustic emanations, RefleXnoop actively probes with ultrasound, whose larger bandwidth and lower noise floor offers a finer resolution. To further maximize its performance, RefleXnoop exploits the laptop's screen reflection to enhance diversity in sound acquisition, and it innovates in neural models to effectively fuse the diversified sound acquisitions and to achieve robust feature-to-key translation. We implement RefleXnoop with commodity hardware and conduct extensive evaluation on it; the results demonstrate that RefleXnoop achieves 85\\% top-100 accuracy for inferring 8-character passwords on laptop QWERTY-keyboard and in multiple noisy environments."

    "abstract": "UWB ranging systems have been adopted in many critical and security sensitive applications due to its precise positioning and secure ranging capabilities. We present a practical jamming attack, namely UWBAD, against commercial UWB ranging systems, which exploits the vulnerability of the adoption of the normalized cross-correlation process in UWB ranging and can selectively and quickly block ranging sessions without prior knowledge of the configurations of the victim devices, potentially leading to severe consequences such as property loss, unauthorized access, or vehicle theft. UWBAD achieves more effective and less imperceptible jamming due to: (i) it efficiently blocks every ranging session by leveraging the field-level jamming, thereby exerting a tangible impact on commercial UWB ranging systems, and (ii) the compact, reactive, and selective system design based on COTS UWB chips, making it affordable and less imperceptible. We successfully conducted real attacks against commercial UWB ranging systems from the three largest UWB chip vendors on the market, e.g., Apple, NXP, and Qorvo. We reported our findings to Apple, related Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and the Automotive Security Research Group. As of the writing of this paper, the related OEM has acknowledged this vulnerability in their automotive systems and has offered a 5, 000 reward as a bounty."

    "abstract": "Intellectual Property (IP) theft is a cause of major financial and reputational damage, reportedly in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars annually in the U.S. alone. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are particularly exposed to IP theft, because their configuration file contains the IP in a proprietary format that can be mapped to a gate-level netlist with moderate effort. Despite this threat, the scientific understanding of this issue lacks behind reality, thereby preventing an in-depth assessment of IP theft from FPGAs in academia. We address this discrepancy through a real-world case study on a Lattice iCE40 FPGA found inside iPhone 7. Apple refers to this FPGA as Maggie. By reverse engineering the proprietary signal-processing algorithm implemented on Maggie, we generate novel insights into the actual efforts required to commit FPGA IP theft and the challenges an attacker faces on the way. Informed by our case study, we then introduce generalized netlist reverse engineering techniques that drastically reduce the required manual effort and are applicable across a diverse spectrum of FPGA implementations and architectures. We evaluate these techniques on six benchmarks that are representative of different FPGA applications and have been synthesized for Xilinx and Lattice FPGAs, as well as in an end-to-end white-box case study. Finally, we provide a comprehensive open-source tool suite of netlist reverse engineering techniques to foster future research, enable the community to perform realistic threat assessments, and facilitate the evaluation of novel countermeasures."

    "abstract": "Masking is one of the most popular countermeasures to protect implementations against power and electromagnetic side-channel attacks because it offers provable security. Masking has been shown secure against d-threshold probing adversaries by Ishai et al. at CRYPTO'03, but this adversary's model doesn't consider any physical hardware defaults and thus such masking schemes were shown to be still vulnerable when implemented as hardware circuits. To address these limitations glitch-extended probing adversaries and correspondingly glitch-immune masking schemes have been introduced. This paper introduces glitch-stopping circuits, which coincide with circuits protected via glitch-immune masking when instantiated with registers. Then we show that one can instantiate glitch-stopping circuits without registers by using clocked logic gates or latches. This is illustrated for both ASIC and FPGA, offering a promising alternative to conventional register-based masked implementations. Compared to the traditional register-based approach, these register-free solutions can reduce the latency to a single cycle and achieve a lower area cost. We prove and experimentally confirm that the proposed solution is as secure as the register-based one. In summary, this paper proposes a novel method to address the latency of register-based hardware masking without jeopardizing their security. This method not only reduces the latency down to one clock cycle but also improves the area costs of the implementations."

    "abstract": "NIST issued a new call in 2023 to diversify the portfolio of quantum-resistant digital signature schemes since the current portfolio relies on lattice problems. The MAYO scheme, which builds on the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) problem, is a promising candidate for this new call. MAYO introduces emulsifier maps and a novel 'whipping' technique to significantly reduce the key sizes compared to previous UOV schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the implementation aspects of MAYO and proposes several optimization techniques that we use to implement a high-speed hardware accelerator. The first optimization technique is the partial unrolling of the emulsification process to increase parallelization. The second proposed optimization is a novel memory structure enabling the parallelization of significant bottlenecks in the MAYO scheme. In addition to this, we present a flexible transposing technique for the data format used in MAYO that can be expanded to other UOV-based schemes. We use these techniques to design the first high-speed ASIC and FPGA accelerator that supports all operations of the MAYO scheme for different NIST security levels. Compared with state-of-the-art, like HaMAYO [24] and UOV [7], our FPGA design shows a performance benefit of up to three orders of magnitude in both latency and area-time-product. Furthermore, we lower the BRAM consumption by up to 2.8 \\texttimes{} compared to these FPGA implementations. Compared to high-end CPU implementations, our ASIC design allows between 2.81\\texttimes{} and 60.14\\texttimes{} higher throughputs. This increases the number of signing operations per second from 483 to 13424, thereby fostering performant deployment of the MAYO scheme in time-critical applications."

To protect statically stored sensitive data in CiM, designers have implemented various hardware obfuscation techniques in CiM architectures. However, we observe that existing CiM obfuscation defense strategies are based on straightforward static-key deployment strategies, which pose vulnerabilities from the perspective of key-pruning algorithms for de-obfuscation.This work proposes CiMSAT, a CiM de-obfuscation methodology based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) theory. We conduct the first security analysis specifically tailored to the storage and mixed-signal computing features of CiM architecture, which are two key challenges to de-obfuscate existing state-of-the-art CiM defenses. To model storage units, we innovatively fit and utilize the \"no-inference-value\" obfuscated data for function approximation. To reconstruct mixed-signal circuits, we design bias-tolerant SAT to address the biases introduced by the approximation. With the proposed workflow, we investigate and evaluate all the existing 14 CiM obfuscation architectures using our de-obfuscation framework. We model a total of 176 defense vectors derived from different defense techniques and parameters, among which 158 (90\\%) can be de-obfuscated and returned the keys within 1,000 seconds and 172 (98\\%) defenses can be recovered within 105 seconds (approximately one day).

Automated approaches have been shown to be promising but are currently extremely computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practice. We here propose QueryCheetah, a fast and effective method for automated discovery of privacy attacks against QBSs. We instantiate QueryCheetah on attribute inference attacks and show it to discover stronger attacks than previous methods while being 18 times faster than the state-of-the-art automated approach. We then show how QueryCheetah allows system developers to thoroughly evaluate the privacy risk, including for various attacker strengths and target individuals.

We investigate how different uncertainties of the adversary affect their inferential power via extensive experiments on five datasets across various data modalities. Our results demonstrate the inefficacy of solely relying on data aggregation to achieve privacy against inference attacks in distributed learning. We further evaluate five types of defenses, namely, gradient pruning, signed gradient descent, adversarial perturbations, variational information bottleneck, and differential privacy, under both static and adaptive adversary settings. We provide an information-theoretic view for analyzing the effectiveness of these defenses against inference from gradients.

    "abstract": "Most existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) utilize metrics (e.g., loss) calculated on the model's final state, while recent advanced attacks leverage metrics computed at various stages, including both intermediate and final stages, throughout the model training. Nevertheless, these attacks often process multiple intermediate states of the metric independently, ignoring their time-dependent patterns. Consequently, they struggle to effectively distinguish between members and non-members who exhibit similar metric values, particularly resulting in a high false-positive rate.In this study, we delve deeper into the new membership signals in the black-box scenario. We identify a new, more integrated membership signal: the Pattern of Metric Sequence, derived from the various stages of model training. We contend that current signals provide only partial perspectives of this new signal: the new one encompasses both the model's multiple intermediate and final states, with a greater emphasis on temporal patterns among them. Building upon this signal, we introduce a novel attack method called Sequential-metric based Membership Inference Attack (SeqMIA). Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to obtain a set of distilled models representing various stages of the target model's training. We then assess multiple metrics on these distilled models in chronological order, creating distilled metric sequence. We finally integrate distilled multi-metric sequences as a sequential multiformat and employ an attention-based RNN attack model for inference. Empirical results show SeqMIA outperforms all baselines, especially can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in terms of TPR @ 0.1\\% FPR. Furthermore, we delve into the reasons why this signal contributes to SeqMIA's high attack performance, and assess various defense mechanisms against SeqMIA."

    "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has demonstrated its effectiveness and has become the standard approach for tailoring language models to various tasks. Currently, community-based platforms offer easy access to various pre-trained models, as anyone can publish without strict validation processes. However, a released pre-trained model can be a privacy trap for fine-tuning datasets if it is carefully designed. In this work, we propose PreCurious framework to reveal the new attack surface where the attacker releases the pre-trained model and gets a black-box access to the final fine-tuned model. PreCurious aims to escalate the general privacy risk of both membership inference and data extraction on the fine-tuning dataset. The key intuition behind PreCurious is to manipulate the memorization stage of the pre-trained model and guide fine-tuning with a seemingly legitimate configuration. While empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that parameter-efficient and differentially private fine-tuning techniques can defend against privacy attacks on a fine-tuned model, PreCurious demonstrates the possibility of breaking up this invulnerability in a stealthy manner compared to fine-tuning on a benign pre-trained model. While DP provides some mitigation for membership inference attack, by further leveraging a sanitized dataset, PreCurious demonstrates potential vulnerabilities for targeted data extraction even under differentially private tuning with a strict privacy budget e.g. ε=0.05. Thus, PreCurious raises warnings for users on the potential risks of downloading pre-trained models from unknown sources, relying solely on tutorials or common-sense defenses, and releasing sanitized datasets even after perfect scrubbing."

Hence many privacy auditing tools are emerging for checking if the data sanitization performed meets the privacy standard of the data owner. Blackbox auditing for differential privacy is particularly gaining popularity for its effectiveness and applicability to a wide range of scenarios. Yet, we identified that blackbox auditing is essentially flawed with its setting --- small probabilities/densities are ignored due to inaccurate observation. Our argument is based on a solid false positive analysis from a hypothesis testing perspective, which is missed out by prior blackbox auditing tools. This oversight greatly reduces the reliability of these tools, as it allows malicious or incapable data curators to pass the auditing with an overstated privacy guarantee, posing significant risks to data owners. We demonstrate the practical existence of such threats in classical differential privacy mechanisms against four representative blackbox auditors with experimental validations. Our findings aim to reveal the limitations of blackbox auditing tools, empower the data owner with the awareness of risks in using these tools, and encourage the development of more reliable differential privacy auditing methods."

Existing countermeasures largely focus on determining the genuineness of speech based on complete original audio recordings, which however often contain private content. This oversight may refrain deepfake detection from many applications, particularly in scenarios involving sensitive information like business secrets. In this paper, we propose SafeEar, a novel framework that aims to detect deepfake audios without relying on accessing the speech content within. Our key idea is to devise a neural audio codec into a novel decoupling model that well separates the semantic and acoustic information from audio samples, and only use the acoustic information (e.g., prosody and timbre) for deepfake detection. In this way, no semantic content will be exposed to the detector. To overcome the challenge of identifying diverse deepfake audio without semantic clues, we enhance our deepfake detector with real-world codec augmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate SafeEar's effectiveness in detecting various deepfake techniques with an equal error rate (EER) down to 2.02\\%. Simultaneously, it shields five-language speech content from being deciphered by both machine and human auditory analysis, demonstrated by word error rates (WERs) all above 93.93\\% and our user study.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness.In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt.We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/BHui97/PLeak."

We define a new notion of timing privacy, which captures programs that remain differentially private to an adversary that observes the program's runtime in addition to the output. Our framework enables chaining together component programs that are timing-stable followed by a random delay to obtain DP programs that achieve timing privacy. Importantly, our definitions allow for measuring timing privacy and output privacy using different privacy measures.We illustrate how to instantiate our framework by giving programs for standard DP computations in the RAM and Word RAM models of computation.

We devise the Phantom Link attack and demonstrate a working exploit to highlight the security impacts. To defend against such attacks, we propose Spotlight, a detection method that can alert a system administrator of risky intent updates prone to exploitable temporal vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we develop Exosphere, which detects tunneled attack traffic by analyzing packet length patterns, without investigating any information in packets. Specifically, it utilizes a deep learning based method to analyze the semantics of packet patterns, i.e., the features represent the strong correlations between flooding packets with similar length patterns, and classify attack traffic according to these semantic features. We prove that the strong correlations of packet length patterns ensure the theoretical guarantee of applying semantic analysis to recognize correlated attack packets. We prototype Exosphere with FPGAs and deploy it in a real-world institutional network. The experimental results demonstrate that Exosphere achieves 0.967 F1 accuracy, while detecting flooding traffic generated by unseen attacks and misconfigurations. Moreover, it achieves 0.996 AUC accuracy on existing datasets including various stealthy attacks, and thus significantly outperforms the existing deep learning models. It achieves accuracy comparable to the best performances achieved by 12 state-of-the-art methods that cannot detect tunneled flooding traffic, while improving their efficiency by 6.19 times."

Specifically, field inference is one crucial step in PRE to infer the field formats and semantics. To perform field inference, binary analysis based PRE techniques are one major approach category. However, such techniques face two key challenges --- (1) the format inference is fragile when the logics of processing input messages may vary among different protocol implementations, and (2) the semantic inference is limited by inadequate and inaccurate inference rules.To tackle these challenges, we present BinPRE, a binary analysis based PRE tool. BinPRE incorporates (1) an instruction-based semantic similarity analysis strategy for format extraction; (2) a novel library composed of atomic semantic detectors for improving semantic inference adequacy; and (3) a cluster-and-refine paradigm to further improve semantic inference accuracy. We have evaluated BinPRE against five existing PRE tools, including Polyglot, AutoFormat, Tupni, BinaryInferno and DynPRE. The evaluation results on eight widely-used protocols show that BinPRE outperforms the prior PRE tools in both format and semantic inference. BinPRE achieves the perfection of 0.73 on format extraction and the F1-score of 0.74 (0.81) on semantic inference of types (functions), respectively. The field inference results of BinPRE have helped improve the effectiveness of protocol fuzzing by achieving 5~29\\% higher branch coverage, compared to those of the best prior PRE tool. BinPRE has also helped discover one new zero-day vulnerability, which otherwise cannot be found."

Our approach exposes an overlooked yet widespread attack vector, distinguishing itself from traditional link fabrication attacks that tamper, spoof, or relay discovery packets at the data plane. Unlike localized attacks observed in existing methods, our technique introduces a globalized topology poisoning attack that leverages control privileges. Marionette implements a reinforcement learning algorithm to compute a poisoned topology target, and injects flow entries to achieve a long-lived stealthy attack. Our evaluation shows that Marionette successfully attacks five open-source controllers and nine OpenFlow-based discovery protocols. Marionette overcomes the state-of-the-art topology poisoning defenses, showcasing a new class of topology poisoning that initiates on the control plane.

    "abstract": "The security landscape of software systems has witnessed considerable advancements through dynamic testing methodologies, especially fuzzing. Traditionally, fuzzing involves a sequential, cyclic process where software is tested to identify crashes. These crashes are then triaged and patched, leading to subsequent cycles that uncover further vulnerabilities. While effective, this method is not efficient as each cycle potentially reveals new issues previously obscured by earlier crashes, thus resulting in vulnerabilities being discovered sequentially.In this paper, we present a solution to identify occluded future vulnerabilities - vulnerabilities that are hard or impossible to trigger due to current vulnerabilities occluding the triggering path. We introduce robust fuzzing, a novel technique that enables fuzzers probe beyond the immediate crash location and uncover new vulnerabilities or variants of known ones. We implemented robust fuzzing in FlakJack, a pioneering fuzzing add-on that leverages binary patching to proactively identify occluded future vulnerabilities hidden behind current crashes. By enabling fuzzers to bypass immediate crash points and delve deeper into the software, FlakJack not only accelerates the vulnerability discovery process but also significantly enhances the efficacy of software testing. With the help of FlakJack, we found 28 new vulnerabilities in projects that have been extensively tested through the OSS-Fuzz project. This approach promises a transformative shift in how vulnerabilities are identified and managed, aiming to shorten the time span of vulnerability discovery over the long term."

The choice of the underlying representation (e.g., a sequence of tokens, an abstract syntax tree, or an intermediate representation) defines the possible mutation space and subsequently influences the design of mutation operators. Current program representations in JS engine fuzzers center around abstract syntax trees and customized bytecode-level intermediate languages. However, existing efforts struggle to generate semantically valid and meaningful mutations, limiting the discovery of defects in JS engines.Our proposed graph-based intermediate representation, FlowIR, directly represents the JS control flow and data flow as the mutation target. FlowIR is essential for the implementation of powerful semantic mutation. It supports mutation operators at the data flow and control flow level, thereby expanding the granularity of mutation operators. Experimental results show that our method is more effective in discovering new bugs. Our prototype, FuzzFlow, outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in generating valid test cases and exploring code coverage.

While these XPUs provide critical functionalities, their security protections are generally weaker than those of CPUs, making them attractive attack targets. In particular, Apple silicon optimizes memory usage by adopting a unified memory architecture (UMA), which employs shared memory regions (termed cross-XPU memory) to facilitate communication between CPUs and XPUs. Although the cross-XPU memory enhances performance, it also introduces a new attack surface. Unfortunately, the difficulty in identifying effective shared memory regions and generating valid payloads makes fuzzing cross-XPU memory a challenging problem that cannot be resolved effectively by existing fuzzing techniques.Therefore, we propose CrossFire, the first fuzzer targeting Apple silicon XPU by fuzzing cross-XPU memory, to evaluate this new attack surface. Initially, we conduct an in-depth cross-XPU memory analysis to investigate the challenges of fuzzing XPU. To address these challenges, CrossFire introduces two novel techniques to pinpoint effective fuzzing regions in cross-XPU memory and trace kernel execution information to extract data constraints. Leveraging these techniques, we develop CrossFire based on the m1n1 hypervisor to monitor cross-XPU memory accesses and perform grey-box hooking-based fuzzing. We further evaluate CrossFire on macOS Ventura, where it has identified 15 new zero-day bugs, 8 of which have been confirmed by Apple."

However, code coverage is not sufficient for operating system kernels, for they contain many untracked but interesting features, such as comparison operands, kernel state identifiers, flags, and executable code, within its data segments, that reflects different execution patterns, and can profoundly increase the granularity and scope of the coverage metrics.This paper proposes the use of Kernel Binary Coverage Feedback, a comprehensive and effective execution feedback method that provides metrics reflecting the execution coverage status of the entire binary coverage to kernel fuzzers. Our approach abstracts program behavior as its memory access pattern during execution, and considers all such relevant behavior, including standard memory reads and writes, predicate comparisons, etc., to obtain a coverage metric on the whole kernel binary for input generation guidance.We implemented a prototype tool KBinCov and integrated it into a popular kernel fuzzer Syzkaller. We evaluated its effectiveness against vanilla Syzkaller, as well as certain other approaches, including StateFuzz and IJON. Our results show that KBinCov achieves code and binary coverage increases of 7\\%, 7\\%, 9\\%, and 87\\%, 34\\%, 61\\%, compared to Syzkaller (using kcov), StateFuzz, and IJON, on recent versions of the Linux kernels, respectively, while only incurring a 1.74\\texttimes{} overhead increase, less than StateFuzz and IJON's 2.5x and 2.2x figures.

However, understanding, modifying, and retargeting binary code can be complex tasks. To counter these difficulties, binary lifters have been introduced. These tools translate binary code into Intermediate Representations (IRs), providing several advantages, such as enabling modifications to executables without source code and facilitating code retargetability. So far, accurately developing binary lifters for modern ISAs is universally acknowledged as challenging and error-prone. Existing validation methods mainly concentrate on isolated instructions, overlooking interactions among instructions. In this paper, we introduce LiftFuzz, a novel framework that leverages instruction context-aware fuzzing to validate binary lifters. LiftFuzz harnesses an assembly language model to learn interactions among instructions and generates test cases with the knowledge. LiftFuzz greatly outperforms the baseline, requiring only 1/1000 of the test cases used by the baseline to identify 26 inconsistencies, including a previously uncovered category. LiftFuzz significantly contributes to enhancing the performance of binary lifters, which are frequently employed in binary security applications."

Adversarial training is one of the most promising and practical methods to enhance model robustness. Existing adversarial training methods, however, assume access to the original training data. But nowadays, more and more users directly download models from the open-source model platforms or tech companies, but the original training datasets are usually unreleased because of commercial interests or privacy. In such scenarios, the user cannot utilize the former adversarial training methods to improve model robustness because of the lack of original training datasets. Thus, we present the first exploration of a data-free adversarial training framework, Alchemy, which seeks to enhance model robustness without requiring access to the original training data. By addressing the notable challenges of reconstructing high-quality training data with robust features and improving the adversarial robustness to the inaccessible original dataset, our approach achieves the goals of both high accuracy maintenance and robustness improvement. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets compared with five baselines, demonstrate Alchemy's high effectiveness. With no access to any training dataset, the average robustness improvement with Alchemy is effective in most attack scenarios. Additional evaluations underscore the framework's stability under different settings and discuss future research directions."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision like object detection with their unparalleled performance. However, existing research has shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In the physical world, an adversary could exploit adversarial patches to implement a Hiding Attack (HA) which patches the target object to make it disappear from the detector, and an Appearing Attack (AA) which fools the detector into misclassifying the patch as a specific object. Recently, many defense methods for detectors have been proposed to mitigate the potential threats of adversarial patches. However, such methods still have limitations in generalization, robustness and efficiency. Most defenses are only effective against the HA, leaving the detector vulnerable to the AA.In this paper, we propose NutNet, an innovative model for detecting adversarial patches, with high generalization, robustness and efficiency. With experiments for six detectors including YOLOv2-v4, SSD, Faster RCNN and DETR on both digital and physical domains, the results show that our proposed method can effectively defend against both the HA and AA, with only 0.4\\% sacrifice of the clean performance. We compare NutNet with four baseline defense methods for detectors, and our method exhibits an average defense performance that is over 2.4 times and 4.7 times higher than existing approaches for HA and AA, respectively. In addition, NutNet only increases the inference time by 8\\%, which can meet the real-time requirements of the detection systems.

Nevertheless, model owners may face the potential threats of model extraction attacks where malicious users replicate valuable commercial models based on query results. Existing defenses against model extraction attacks, however, either sacrifice prediction accuracy or fail to thwart more advanced attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel model extraction defense, dubbed Beowulf 1 , which draws inspiration from theoretical findings that models with complex and narrow decision regions are difficult to be reproduced. Rather than arbitrarily altering decision regions, which may jeopardize the predictive capacity of the victim model, we introduce a dummy class, carefully synthesized using both random and adversarial noises. The random noise broadens the coverage of the dummy class, and the adversarial noise impacts decision regions near decision boundaries with normal classes. To further improve the model utility, we propose to employ data augmentation methods to seamlessly integrate the dummy class and the normal classes. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette datasets demonstrate that Beowulf can significantly reduce the extraction accuracy of 6 state-of-the-art model extraction attacks by as much as 80\\%. Moreover, we show that Beowulf is also robust to adaptive model extraction attacks."

To effectively integrate these diverse sources, we develop a system based on the conditional random field that models objects and relationships as a spatial-temporal graph for holistic reasoning on the perceived scene.

MLaaS provides inference service with low inference latency based on an ML model trained using a dataset collected from numerous individual data owners. Recently, for the sake of data owners' privacy and to comply with the \"right to be forgotten (RTBF)\" as enacted by data protection legislation, many machine unlearning methods have been proposed to remove data owners' data from trained models upon their unlearning requests. However, despite their promising efficiency, almost all existing machine unlearning methods handle unlearning requests independently from inference requests, which unfortunately introduces a new security issue of inference service obsolescence and a privacy vulnerability of undesirable exposure for machine unlearning in MLaaS.In this paper, we propose the ERASER framework for machin&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; unlea&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;ning in MLa&lt;u&gt;AS&lt;/u&gt; via an inferenc&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; se&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;ving-aware approach.

Eclipse works by propagating artificial data dependencies onto sensitive data, preventing the CPU from using attacker-controlled data during speculative execution. We demonstrate that Eclipse provides comprehensive protection against speculative-probing and Pacman-style attacks, two prominent examples of Speculative Memory-error Abuse attacks that target both the x86(-64) and ARM architectures.

Prior studies primarily focus on the memory safety of the eBPF runtimes, but few can detect implementation flaws (i.e., whether the implementation is correct).

We have implemented a prototype of BpfChecker and extensively evaluated it on the three eBPF runtimes (i.e., Solana rBPF, vanilla rBPF, Windows eBPF).

    "abstract": "Java Virtual Machine (JVM) holds a crucial position in executing various Java programs, thereby necessitating rigorous testing to ensure software reliability and security. Regarding existing JVM testing techniques, synthesis-based techniques have proven to be state-of-the-art, which construct a test program by synthesizing various program ingredients extracted from historical bug-revealing test programs into a seed program. However, existing synthesis-based techniques directly use the program ingredients specific to historical bugs, which limits the test scope without the ability of covering more JVM features and negatively affects the diversity of synthesized test programs.This paper introduces a paradigm of ''ingredient abstraction and instantiation'' for synthesis-based JVM testing and develops a new technique called Jetris. Instead of merely inserting the specific program ingredients into different seed programs, Jetris leverages the knowledge derived from historical bug-revealing program ingredients to generalize bug-revealing patterns (i.e., control- and data-flow patterns), and then utilizes these patterns as guidance to generate more program ingredients. To achieve a more comprehensive exploration, we enrich the generated ingredients by incorporating various program elements (e.g., new data type). We extensively evaluated Jetris on four Long-Term Support OpenJDK versions of two mainstream JVMs (i.e., HotSpot and OpenJ9). The experimental results demonstrate that Jetris can detect more unique bugs than existing techniques, and the test programs generated by Jetris can achieve higher JVM code coverage. Additionally, Jetris successfully detects 21 previously unknown bugs in these mainstream JVMs, and 13 of them have been confirmed/fixed by developers. Moreover, Jetris has been successfully applied to a new JVM implementation in a global IT company and detected 9 bugs during the practical evaluation."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of open-source software (OSS) has led to extensive code reuse, making vulnerabilities in OSS significantly pervasive. The vulnerabilities due to code reuse in OSS are commonly known as vulnerable code clones (VCCs) or recurring vulnerabilities. Existing approaches primarily employ clone-based techniques to detect recurring vulnerabilities by matching vulnerable functions in software projects. These techniques do not incorporate specially designed mechanisms for vulnerabilities with multiple fixing functions (VM). Typically, they generate a signature for each fixing function and report VM using a matching-one-in-all approach. However, the variation in vulnerability context across diverse fixing functions results in varying accuracy levels in detecting VM, potentially limiting the effectiveness of existing methods.In this paper, we introduce VMud, a novel approach for detecting Vulnerabilities with Multiple Fixing Functions. VMud identifies vulnerable function clones (VCCs) through function matching similar to existing methods. However, VMud takes a different approach by only selecting the critical functions from VM for signature generation, which are a subset of the fixing functions. This step ensures that VMud focuses on fixing functions that offer sufficient knowledge about the VM. To cope with the potential decrease in recall due to excluding the remaining fixing functions, VMud employs semantic equivalent statement matching using these critical functions. It aims to uncover more VM by creating two signatures of each critical function and matching precisely by contextual semantic equivalent statement mapping on the two signatures. Our evaluation has demonstrated that VMud surpasses state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches by 30.30\\% in terms of F1-Score. Furthermore, VMud has successfully detected 275 new VM from 84 projects, with 42 confirmed cases and 5 assigned CVE identifiers."

    "abstract": "Fuzz testing, a technique for detecting critical software vulnerabilities, combines various methodologies from previous research to improve its effectiveness. For fuzzing practitioners, it is imperative to comprehend the effects of distinct techniques and select the ideal configuration customized to the program they need to test.However, evaluating the individual contributions of these techniques is often very difficult. Prior research compared assembled fuzzers and studied their affinity with different programs. Nevertheless, assembled fuzzers cannot be easily broken down into independent components, and therefore, the evaluation does not clarify which technique explains the performance of the fuzzer. Without understanding the potential impact of integrating different fuzzing techniques, it becomes even more challenging to adjust the fuzzer configuration for different programs under test.Our research tackles this challenge by introducing a novel approach that correlates static analysis features extracted at compile time with the performance results of various fuzzing techniques. Our method uses diverse metrics to uncover the relationship between the static attributes of a program and the dynamic runtime performance of fuzzers. The correlation analysis performed on 23 target applications reveals interesting relationships, such as power schedulers performing better with larger programs and context-sensitive feedback, struggling with a large number of inputs.This approach not only enhances our analytical understanding of fuzzing techniques, but also enables predictive capabilities. We show how a simple machine learning model can propose a fuzzer configuration customized for a particular program using information collected through static analysis. In 11 of our benchmark programs, fuzzers using the suggested configuration achieved the best improvement over the baseline compared to AFLplusplus, LibFuzzer and Honggfuzz."

We conduct a cryptographic analysis of various products in the ecosystem, showing that many providers fail to provide an adequate level of security. In particular, we provide an in-depth analysis of five end-to-end encrypted cloud storage systems, namely Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit, in the setting of a malicious server. These companies cumulatively have over 22 million users and are major providers in the field. We unveil severe cryptographic vulnerabilities in four of them. Our attacks invalidate the marketing claims made by the providers of these systems, showing that a malicious server can, in some cases, inject files in the encrypted storage of users, tamper with file data, and even gain direct access to the content of the files. Many of our attacks affect multiple providers in the same way, revealing common failure patterns in independent cryptographic designs. We conclude by discussing the significance of these patterns beyond the security of the specific providers."

    "abstract": "Secure join queries over encrypted databases, the most expressive class of SQL queries, have attracted extensive attention recently. The state-of-the-art JXT (Jutla et al. ASIACRYPT 2022) enables join queries on encrypted relational databases without pre-computing all possible joins. However, JXT can merely support join queries over two tables (in encrypted databases) with some high-entropy join attributes. In this paper, we propose an equi-join query protocol over two tables dubbed JXT+, that allows the join attributes with arbitrary names instead of JXT requiring the identical name for join attributes. JXT+ reduces the query complexity from O(ell_1 cdot ell_2) to O(ell_1) as compared to JXT, where ell_1 and ell_2 denote the numbers of matching records in two tables respectively. Furthermore, we present JXT++, the first equi-join queries across three or more tables over encrypted databases without pre-computation. Specifically, JXT++ supports joins of arbitrary attributes, i.e., all attributes (even low-entropy) can be candidates for join, while JXT requires high-entropy join attributes. In addition, JXT++ can alleviate sub-query leakage on three or more tables, which hides the leakage from the matching records of two-table join. Finally, we implement and compare our proposed schemes with the state-of-the-art JXT. The experimental results demonstrate that both of our schemes are superior to JXT in search and storage costs. In particular, JXT+ (resp., JXT++) brings a saving of 49\\% (resp., 68\\%) in server storage cost and achieves a speedup of 51.7\\texttimes{} (resp., 54.3\\texttimes{}) in search latency."

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving graph analysis allows performing computations on graphs that store sensitive information while ensuring all the information about the topology of the graph, as well as data associated with the nodes and edges, remains hidden. The current work addresses this problem by designing a highly scalable framework, Graphiti, that allows securely realising any graph algorithm. Graphiti relies on the technique of secure multiparty computation (MPC) to design a generic framework that improves over the state-of-the-art framework of GraphSC by Araki et al. (CCS'21). The key technical contribution is that Graphiti has round complexity independent of the graph size, which in turn allows attaining the desired scalability. Specifically, this is achieved by (i) decoupling the Scatter primitive of GraphSC into separate operations of Propagate and ApplyE, (ii) designing a novel constant-round approach to realise Propagate, as well as (iii) designing a novel constant-round approach to realise the Gather primitive of GraphSC by leveraging the linearity of the aggregation operation. We benchmark the performance of Graphiti for the application of contact tracing via BFS for 10 hops and observe that it takes less than 2 minutes when computing over a graph of size 10^7. Concretely it improves over the state-of-the-art up to a factor of 1034\\texttimes{} in online run time. Similar to GraphSC by Araki et al., since Graphiti relies on a secure protocol for shuffle, we additionally design a shuffle protocol secure against a semi-honest adversary in the 2-party with a helper setting. Given the versatility of shuffle protocol, the designed solution is of independent interest. Hence, we also benchmark the performance of the designed shuffle where we observe improvements of up to 1.83\\texttimes{} in online run time when considering an input vector of size 10^7, in comparison to the state-of-the-art in the considered setting."

    "abstract": "Collaborative graph learning represents a learning paradigm where multiple parties jointly train a graph neural network (GNN) using their own proprietary graph data. To honor the data privacy of all parties, existing solutions for collaborative graph learning are either based on federated learning (FL) or secure machine learning (SML). Although promising in terms of efficiency and scalability due to their distributed training scheme, FL-based approaches fall short in providing provable security guarantees and achieving good model performance. Conversely, SML-based solutions, while offering provable privacy guarantees, are hindered by their high computational and communication overhead, as well as poor scalability as more parties participate.To address the above problem, we propose CoGNN, a novel framework that simultaneously reaps the benefits of both FL-based and SML-based approaches. At a high level, CoGNN is enabled by (i) a novel message passing mechanism that can obliviously and efficiently express the vertex data propagation/aggregation required in GNN training and inference and (ii) a two-stage Dispatch-Collect execution scheme to securely decompose and distribute the GNN computation workload for concurrent and scalable executions. We further instantiate the CoGNN framework, together with customized optimizations, to train Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models. Extensive evaluations on three graph datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SML-based approach, CoGNN reduces up to 123x running time and up to 522x communication cost per party. Meanwhile, the GCN models trained using CoGNN have nearly identical accuracies as the plaintext global-graph training, yielding up to 11.06\\% accuracy improvement over the GCN models trained via federated learning."

PathGES leverages a novel data structure that minimizes leakage and server computation.We generalize what it means for one leakage function to leak less than another by defining a relation with respect to a family of query sequences and show that our scheme provably leaks less than the GKT scheme when all queries have been issued. We complement our security proof with a cryptanalysis that demonstrates an information-theoretic gap in the size of the query reconstruction space of our scheme as compared to the GKT scheme and provide concrete examples of the gap for several graph families. Our prototype implementation of PathGES is efficient in practice for real-world social network and geographic data sets. In comparison with the GKT scheme, PathGES has the same response size on average and up to 1.5x faster round-trip query time."

In particular, the confidentiality of the highest bid and the identity of the second highest bidder are protected. We model the bidders participating in the second price auction as rational, computationally bounded and privacy-sensitive parties. These are self-interested agents who care about winning the auction more than learning about the private bids of other parties. A rational party does not deviate from the protocol arbitrarily but does so only for its own individual 'advantage' -- without any consideration for others. Such an advantage is modelled using suitable utility functions.We show that for rational and computationally bounded parties participating in our second-price auctions protocol, there exists a privacy-preserving dominant strategy equilibrium in which every party prefers to follow the protocol rather than to deviate.Our protocol is implemented using open-source cryptographic constructs. Running our SPA protocol on commodity hardware with 15 bidders, with bids of length 10 bits, completes in 1.26sec and has total communication of 0.77MB whereas, under similar conditions, Atlas (semi-honest) protocol takes 40\\% more time (2.11 sec) and 87\\% more communication (6.09MB)."

    "abstract": "RAM (random access memory) is an important primitive in verifiable computation. In this paper, we focus on realizing RAM with efficient batching property, i.e, proving a batch of m updates on a RAM of size N while incurring a cost that is sublinear in N. Classical approaches based on Merkle-trees or address ordered transcripts to model RAM correctness are either concretely inefficient, or incur linear overhead in the size of the RAM. Recent works explore cryptographic accumulators based on unknown-order groups (RSA, class-groups) to model the RAM state. While recent RSA accumulator based approaches offer significant improvement over classical methods, they incur linear overhead in the size of the accumulated set to compute witnesses, as well as prohibitive constant overheads.We realize a batching-efficient RAM with superior asymptotic and concrete costs as compared to existing approaches. Towards this: (i) we build on recent constructions of lookup arguments to allow efficient lookups even in presence of table updates, and (ii) we realize a variant of sub-vector relation addressed in prior works, which we call committed index lookup. We combine the two building blocks to realize batching-efficient RAM with sublinear dependence on size of the RAM. Our construction incurs an amortized proving cost of ~O(m log m + √(mN)) for a batch of m updates on a RAM of size N. Our results also benefit the recent arguments for sub-vector relation, by enabling them to be efficient in presence of updates to the table. We believe that this is a contribution of independent interest.We implement our solution to evaluate its concrete efficiency. Our experiments show that it offers significant improvement over existing works on batching-efficient accumulators/RAMs, with a substantially reduced resource barrier."

In particular, we develop a generic framework for converting PIR schemes for index queries over flat arrays (based on the Learning With Errors problem) into keyword PIR. This involves representing a key-value map using any probabilistic filter that permits reconstruction of elements from inclusion queries (e.g. Cuckoo filters). In particular, we make use of recently developed Binary Fuse filters to construct ChalametPIR, with minimal efficiency blow-up compared with state-of-the-art index-based schemes (all costs bounded by a factor of (≤ 1.08)). Furthermore, we show that ChalametPIR achieves runtimes and financial costs that are factors of between (6x)-(11x) and (3.75x)-(11.4x) more efficient, respectively, than state-of-the-art keyword PIR approaches, for varying database configurations. Bandwidth costs are additionally reduced or remain competitive, depending on the configuration. Finally, we believe that our application of Binary Fuse filters can have independent value towards developing efficient variants of related cryptographic primitives (e.g. private set intersection), that already benefit from using less efficient filter constructions."

    "abstract": "The shuffle model has recently emerged as a popular setting for differential privacy, where clients can communicate with a central server using anonymous channels or an intermediate message shuffler. This model was also explored in the context of cryptographic tasks such as secure aggregation and private information retrieval (PIR). However, this study was almost entirely restricted to the stringent notion of information-theoretic security.In this work, we study computationally secure aggregation protocols and PIR in the shuffle model. Our starting point is the insight that the previous technique of shuffling additive shares can be improved in the computational setting. We show that this indeed holds under the standard learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption, but even better efficiency follows from plausible conjectures about the multi-disjoint syndrome decoding (MDSD) problem that we introduce and study in this work.We leverage the above towards improving the efficiency of secure aggregation and PIR in the shuffle model. For secure aggregation of long vectors, our protocols require 9x--25x less communication than the previous information-theoretic solutions. Our PIR protocols enjoy the simplicity and concrete efficiency benefits of multi-server PIR while only requiring a single server to store the database. Under the MDSD assumption, they improve over recent single-server PIR constructions by up to two orders of magnitude."

    "abstract": "Multi-party private set intersection (MPSI) allows n (ngeq3) participants, each holding a dataset of size m, to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing any additional information. We extract a primitive called bicentric zero-sharing, which can reduce MPSI to two-party PSI between two central participants named Pivot and Leader. We introduce an efficient instantiation of bicentric zero-sharing, which involves a round of sharing and reconstruction of an oblivious key-value store (OKVS) object. We then combine this construction with two-party PSI to propose a new efficient scalable MPSI protocol. We also propose protocols for computing MPSI variants based on bicentric zero-sharing, such as multi-party private set intersection cardinality (MPSI-CA) and multi-party threshold private set intersection (MTPSI). Our protocols are mainly based on symmetric-key operations, and the communication complexity of each participant is at most O(n+m). The security of our protocols relies on the assumption that Leader and Pivot do not collude, which can be applicable in many scenarios. In this case, our protocols are secure against arbitrary collusion (except Leader and Pivot) in the semi-honest model. Moreover, our protocols are secure against up to n-2 malicious Clients (participants except Leader and Pivot) in the random oracle model. All these protocols realize the scalability with the number of participants.We demonstrate the scalability of our protocols with an implementation and a comparison with the state-of-the-art MPSI. Experiments show that when computing MPSI for 15 participants with datasets of 220 elements each, our protocol is 46.4x faster in the LAN setting, 18.3x faster in WAN setting, and requires 24.7x less communication cost compared to the state-of-the-art in CCS'21 (by Nevo et al.), and the improvement becomes more significant as the number of participants and set size increases. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first protocols that report on more than 100 participants. For 140 participants with datasets of 220 elements each, our MPSI and MPSI-CA protocol requires only 4.557s and 16.02s in the LAN setting, respectively."

In this paper we close this gap and propose the first three-party DPF construction that matches the state-of-the-art two-party DPF on all metrics. Namely, it is secure against a malicious adversary corrupting both the dealer and one out of the three evaluators, its function's shares are of the same size and evaluation takes the same time as in the best two-party DPF. Compared to the state-of-the-art three-party DPF, our construction enjoys 40-120\\texttimes{} smaller function's share size and shorter evaluation time, for function domains of 216 -240, respectively.Apart from DPFs as a stand-alone tool, our construction finds immediate applications to private information retrieval (PIR), writing (PIW) and oblivious RAM (ORAM). To further showcase its applicability, we design and implement an ORAM with access policy, an extension to ORAMs where a policy is being checked before accessing the underlying database. The policy we plug-in is the one suitable for account-based digital currencies, and in particular to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Our protocol offers the first design and implementation of a large scale privacy-preserving account-based digital currency.

Many organizations rely on phishing simulations to educate their staff to recognize suspicious e-mails. Previous studies have analyzed the effectiveness of these phishing simulations with mixed findings. However, the perception of and attitudes towards phishing simulations among staff have received little to no attention. This paper presents findings from a study that we carried out in cooperation with a multinational company that conducted phishing simulations over more than 12 months. We first conducted a quantitative survey involving 757 employees and then qualitative interviews with 22 participants to gain deeper insights into the perception of phishing simulations and the corresponding e-learning. We could not find evidence that employees feel attacked by their organization, as previous studies suspected. On the contrary, we found that a majority 86.9 \\% have a positive or very positive attitude towards phishing simulations. The interviews revealed that some employees developed new routines for e-mail processing, but most describe themselves as having become more vigilant without concrete changes. Furthermore, we found evidence that phishing simulations create a false sense of security, as the employees feel protected by them. Additionally, a lack of communication and feedback can negatively impact employees' attitudes and lead to adverse consequences. Finally, we show that only a small portion of the employees who clicked on the phishing website interacted with the interactive e-learning elements, which raises questions about its objective usefulness, although they are perceived as useful."

This widespread practice is dubbed embedded training; however, its effectiveness in decreasing the likelihood of employees falling for phishing again in the future is questioned by the contradictory findings of several recent field studies.We investigate embedded phishing training in three aspects. First, we observe that the practice incorporates different components---knowledge gains from its content, nudges and reminders from the test itself, and the deterrent effect of potential consequences---our goal is to study which ones are more effective, if any. Second, we explore two potential improvements to training, namely its timing and the use of incentives. Third, we analyze employees' reception and perception of the practice. For this, we conducted a large-scale mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) study on the employees of a partner company.Our study contributes several novel findings on the training practice: in particular, its effectiveness comes from its nudging effect, i.e., the periodic reminder of the threat rather than from its content, which is rarely consumed by employees due to lack of time and perceived usefulness. Further, delaying training to ease time pressure is as effective as currently established practices, while rewards do not improve secure behavior. Finally, some of our results support previous findings with increased ecological validity, e.g., that phishing is an attention problem, rather than a knowledge one, even for the most susceptible employees, and thus enforcing training does not help."

Our data set contains 992 unique test cases, which are produced from 3,449 source files in the GCC test suite. After analyzing 2,978,976 binary programs that we compiled with two compilers and various compilation flags, we found that although some optimizations make DSE faster, most optimizations will actually slow down DSE.

The most positive impacts that optimizations have on DSE come from the reduction of the number of instructions and program paths, whereas negative impacts are caused by a series of unexpected behaviors, including increased numbers of instructions or program paths, library function inlining preventing DSE engines from using function summaries, and arithmetic optimizations leading to more sophisticated constraints. Being the first in-depth analysis on why compiler flags influence the performance of DSE, this project sheds light on program transformations that can be applied before performing DSE tasks for better performance."

    "abstract": "Solana gained considerable attention as one of the most popular blockchain platforms for deploying decentralized applications. Compared to Ethereum, however, we observe a lack of research on how Solana smart contract developers handle security, what challenges they encounter, and how this affects the overall security of the ecosystem. To address this, we conducted the first comprehensive study on the Solana platform consisting of a 90-minute Solana smart contract code review task with 35 participants followed by interviews with a subset of seven participants. Our study shows, quite alarmingly, that none of the participants could detect all important security vulnerabilities in a code review task and that 83\\% of the participants are likely to release vulnerable smart contracts. Our study also sheds light on the root causes of developers' challenges with Solana smart contract development, suggesting the need for better security guidance and resources. In spite of these challenges, our automated analysis on currently deployed Solana smart contracts surprisingly suggests that the prevalence of vulnerabilities - especially those pointed out as the most challenging in our developer study - is below 0.3\\%. We explore the causes of this counter-intuitive resilience and show that frameworks, such as Anchor, are aiding Solana developers in deploying secure contracts."

However, its merits have been debated for over a decade, with questions about its security benefits and concerns about its usability impact. Yet to date, masking has received limited prior exploration.In this work, we empirically investigate the security and usability impact of password masking. We first assess the masking practices of popular browsers and websites, demonstrating masking's ubiquity as well as its design diversity. Guided by our real-world observations, we then conduct a mixed-method evaluation of masking for both mobile and PC devices, combining a survey of over 200 participants on their experiences with and perspectives on masking along with user experiments of 600 participants performing password logins under varying masking conditions. Through our study, we uncover misconceptions about masking, masking's usability and security impact, and user preferences on masking's use and its design. Ultimately, our study establishes empirical grounding on how this popular technique manifests in practice, providing recommendations for its use moving forward."

    "publication": "ACM CCS",
    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3670287",
    "abstract": "With the demand of cryptocurrencies, threshold ECDSA recently regained popularity. So far, several methods have been proposed to construct threshold ECDSA, including the usage of OT and homomorphic encryptions (HE). Due to the mismatch between the plaintext space and the signature space, HE-based threshold ECDSA always requires zero-knowledge range proofs, such as Paillier and Joye-Libert (JL) encryptions. However, the overhead of range proofs constitutes a major portion of the total cost.In this paper, we propose efficient batch range proofs to improve the efficiency of threshold ECDSA. At the heart of our efficiency improvement is a new technical tool calledMulti-Dimension Forking Lemma, as a generalization of the well-known general forking lemma [Bellare and Neven, CCS 2006]. Based on our new tool, we construct efficient batch range proofs for Paillier and JL encryptions, and use them to give batch multiplication-to-addition (MtA) protocols, which are crucial to most threshold ECDSA. Our constructions improve the prior Paillier-based MtA by a factor of 2 and the prior JL-based MtA by a factor of 3, in both computation and bandwidth in an amortized way. Our batch MtA can be used to improve the efficiency of most Paillier and JL based threshold ECDSA. As three typical examples, our benchmarking results show: 1. We improve the Paillier-based CGGMP20 [Canetti et al., CCS 2020] in bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 to 2.4, in computation by a factor of 1.5 to 1.7. 2. By implementing threshold ECDSA with the batch JL MtA of XAL+23 [Xue et al., CCS 2023] and our batch JL MtA respectively, our batch construction improves theirs in bandwidth by a factor of 2.0 to 2.29, in computation by a factor of 1.88 to 2.09. 3. When replacing OT-based MtA in DKLs24 [Doerner et al., S&amp;P 2024] with our Paillier-based batch MtA, we improve the bandwidth efficiency by 7.8\\texttimes{} at the cost of 5.7\\texttimes{} slower computation."

    "abstract": "A cryptographic accumulator is a compact data structure for representing a set of elements coming from some domain. It allows for a compact proof of membership and, in the case of a universal accumulator, non-membership of an element x in the data structure. A dynamic accumulator, furthermore, allows elements to be added to and deleted from the accumulator.Previously known RSA-based dynamic accumulators were too slow in practice because they required that an element in the domain be represented as a prime number. Accumulators based on settings other than RSA had other drawbacks such as requiring a prohibitively large common reference string or a trapdoor, or not permitting deletions.In this paper, we construct an RSA-based dynamic accumulator that does not require that the accumulated elements be represented as primes and show how it can be extended into a universal accumulator. We also show how to aggregate membership and non-membership witnesses and batch additions and deletions. We demonstrate that, for 112-bit, 128-bit, and 192-bit security, the efficiency gains compared to previously known RSA-based accumulators are substantial, and, for the first time, make cryptographic accumulators a viable candidate for a certificate revocation mechanism as part of a WebPKI-type system. To achieve an efficient verification time for aggregated witnesses, we introduce a variant of Wesolowski's proof of exponentiation (Journal of Cryptology 2020) that does not require hashing into primes."

    "abstract": "We put forward a non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (NI-VSS) scheme using class groups - we call it cgVSS. Our construction follows the standard framework of encrypting the shares to a set of recipients and generating a non-interactive proof of correct sharing. However, as opposed to prior works, such as Groth's [Eprint 2021], or Gentry et al.'s [Eurocrypt 2022], we do not require any range proof - this is possible due to the unique structure of class groups, that enables efficient encryption/decryption of large field elements in the exponent of an ElGamal-style encryption scheme. Importantly, this is possible without destroying the additive homomorphic structure, which is required to make the proof-of-correctness highly efficient. This approach not only substantially simplifies the NI-VSS process, but also outperforms the state-of-art schemes significantly. For example, our implementation shows that for a 150 node system cgVSS outperforms (a simplified implementation of) Groth's protocol in overall communication complexity by 5.6x, about 9.3 -- 9.7x in the dealer time and 2.4 - 2.7x in the receiver time per node.Additionally, we formalize the notion of public verifiability, which enables anyone, possibly outside the participants, to verify the correctness of the dealing. In fact, we re-interpret the notion of public verifiability and extend it to the setting when potentially all recipients may be corrupt and yet can not defy public verifiability - to distinguish from state-of-art, we call this strong public verifiability. Our formalization uses the universal composability framework.Finally, through a generic transformation, we obtain a non-interactive distributed key generation (NI-DKG) scheme for threshold systems, where the secret key is the discrete log of the public key. Our security analysis in the VSS-hybrid model uses a formalization that considers a (strong) public verifiability notion for DKG, even when more than threshold parties are corrupt. Instantiating with cgVSS we obtain a NI-DKG scheme from class groups - we call it cgDKG."

Consider Alice who has a Lean proof for some public statement&nbsp;T. Alice wants to convince the world that she has such a proof, without revealing the actual proof. Perhaps the proof shows that a secret program is correct or safe, but the proof itself might leak information about the program's source code. A natural way for Alice to proceed is to construct a succinct, zero-knowledge, non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) to prove that she has a Lean proof for the statement&nbsp;T.In this work we build zkPi, the first zkSNARK for proofs expressed in Lean, a state of the art interactive theorem prover. With zkPi, a prover can convince a verifier that a Lean theorem is true, while revealing little else. The core problem is building an efficient zkSNARK for dependent typing. We evaluate zkPi on theorems from two core Lean libraries: stdlib and mathlib. zkPi successfully proves 57.9\\% of the theorems in stdlib, and 14.1\\% of the theorems in mathlib, within 4.5 minutes per theorem. A zkPi proof is sufficiently short that Fermat could have written one in the margin of his proverbial notebook.Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) can express virtually all systems of formal reasoning.

An ideal zkPoT should offer provable security and privacy guarantees, succinct proof size and verifier runtime, and practical prover efficiency. In this work, we present Kaizen, a zkPoT targeted for deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieves all these goals at once. Our construction enables a prover to iteratively train their model via (mini-batch) gradient descent, where the number of iterations need not be fixed in advance; at the end of each iteration, the prover generates a commitment to the trained model parameters attached with a succinct zkPoT, attesting to the correctness of the executed iterations. The proof size and verifier time are independent of the number of iterations.Our construction relies on two building blocks. First, we propose an optimized GKR-style (sumcheck-based) proof system for the gradient-descent algorithm with concretely efficient prover cost; this allows the prover to generate a proof for each iteration. We then show how to recursively compose these proofs across multiple iterations to attain succinctness. As of independent interest, we propose a generic framework for efficient recursive composition of GKR-style proofs, along with aggregatable polynomial commitments.Benchmarks indicate that Kaizen can handle the training of complex models such as VGG-11 with 10 million parameters and batch size 16. The prover runtime is 15 minutes per iteration, which is 24\\texttimes{} faster than generic recursive proofs, with prover memory overhead 27\\texttimes{} lower.

Since TLS 1.3 is currently utilized by a large number of users, it is imperative to assess the security of these schemes in the multi-user model. Concrete multi-user security analysis for GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 have been scrutinized in literature. However, the formal multi-user security analysis for CCM falls behind that for GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305. Furthermore, in the associated IETF document, the multi-user security bound for CCM is derived by naive generic reduction and falls considerably short of our expectations. In this paper, we bridge the gap by establishing a concrete multi-user security bound for CCM.

    "abstract": "Trusted execution environments (TEEs) are widely employed to protect deep neural networks (DNNs) from untrusted hosts (e.g., hypervisors). By shielding DNNs as fully black-box via encryption, TEEs mitigate model weight leakage and its follow-up white-box attacks. However, this paper uncovers that the confidentiality of TEE-shielded DNNs can be violated due to an emerging threat towards TEEs: ciphertext side channels of TEEs create weight-dependent observations during a DNN's execution. Despite the potential of inferring DNN weights from ciphertext side channels, existing techniques are inapplicable due to their over-strong requirements and the high precision required by DNN weights. A DNN can have millions of weight elements, and even a few incorrectly recovered weight elements may make the DNN non-functional.We propose a novel viewpoint that focuses on the functionality of DNN weights, rather than each weight element's exact value. Accordingly, we design HyperTheft to directly generate weights that are functionality-equivalent to the victim DNN using ciphertext side channels. HyperTheft is established for highly practical settings; it exhibits the weakest requirement compared to prior methods. When only knowing a victim DNN's input type and task type (which are public and denote the minimal information required to use a DNN), HyperTheft can recover its weight using ciphertext side channels logged during the victim DNN's one execution. The whole procedure does not require attackers to 1) query the victim DNN, 2) have valid data that the DNN accepts, or 3) know the victim DNN's structure. Our evaluations generate more than 8K DNN weights which constantly achieve 77\\%~97\\% test accuracy in different DNN runtimes, including various versions of PyTorch and DNN executables.

This work proposes NeuJeans, an FHE-based solution for the PI of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). NeuJeans tackles the critical problem of the enormous computational cost for the FHE evaluation of CNNs. We introduce a novel encoding method called Coefficients-in-Slot (CinS) encoding, which enables multiple convolutions in one HE multiplication without costly slot permutations. We further observe that CinS encoding is obtained by conducting the first several steps of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on a ciphertext in conventional Slot encoding. This property enables us to save the conversion between CinS and Slot encodings as bootstrapping a ciphertext starts with DFT. Exploiting this, we devise optimized execution flows for various two-dimensional convolution (conv2d) operations and apply them to end-to-end CNN implementations. NeuJeans accelerates the performance of conv2d-activation sequences by up to 5.68\\texttimes{} compared to state-of-the-art FHE-based PI work and performs the PI of a CNN at the scale of ImageNet within a mere few seconds."

The training process essentially involves frequent dataset splitting according to the splitting criterion (e.g. Gini impurity). However, existing multi-party training frameworks for decision trees demonstrate communication inefficiency due to the following issues: (1) They suffer from huge communication overhead in securely splitting a dataset with continuous attributes. (2) They suffer from huge communication overhead due to performing almost all the computations on a large ring to accommodate the secure computations for the splitting criterion.In this paper, we are motivated to present an efficient three-party training framework, namely Ents, for decision trees by communication optimization. For the first issue, we present a series of training protocols based on the secure radix sort protocols[17] to efficiently and securely split a dataset with continuous attributes. For the second issue, we propose an efficient share conversion protocol to convert shares between a small ring and a large ring to reduce the communication overhead incurred by performing almost all the computations on a large ring. Experimental results from eight widely used datasets show that Ents outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by 5.5x ~ 9.3\\texttimes{} in communication sizes and 3.9x ~ 5.3\\texttimes{} in communication rounds. In terms of training time, Ents yields an improvement of 3.5x ~ 6.7\\texttimes{}.

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption is one of the main solutions for building secure and privacy-preserving solutions for Machine Learning as a Service, a major challenge in a society where AI becomes more and more pervasive. This motivates the development of homomorphic algorithms for the main building blocks of AI, typically for the components of the various types of neural networks architectures.Among those components, we focus on the Softmax function, defined by Softmax(x ) = (exp(xi) / ∑j=1n exp(xj))1 ≤ i ≤ n. This function is deemed to be one of the most difficult to evaluate homomorphically, because of its multivariate nature and of the very large range of values for exp(xi). The available homomorphic algorithms remain restricted, especially in large dimensions, while important applications such as Large Language Models (LLM) require computing Softmax over large dimensional vectors. Our algorithm has strong scalability properties in terms of range and dimension while maintaining very good numerical accuracy. In terms of multiplicative depth of the computation (a suitable measure of cost for homomorphic algorithms), our algorithm achieves O(log n) complexity for a fixed range of inputs, where n is the Softmax dimension.Our algorithm is especially adapted to the situation where we must compute many Softmax at the same time, for instance, in the LLM situation. In that case, assuming that all Softmax calls are packed into m ciphtertexts, the asymptotic amortized multiplicative depth cost per ciphertext is, again over a fixed range, O(1 + m/N) for N the homomorphic ring degree (typically N=216, so that we have N ≫ m in practice).The main ingredient of our algorithms is a normalize-and-square strategy, which manages to interlace the (numerically unstable) exponential computation over a large range and (very expensive) normalization, decomposing both in stabler and cheaper smaller steps.We have implemented our algorithms using the HEaaN implementation of the CKKS HE system. Comparing ourselves to the state of the art, our experiments show, in practice, a gain of a factor 2.5 to 8 compared to state of the art solutions.These experiments demonstrate good accuracy (around 16-bit precision in the worst case, around 20 on average) and support the linear behavior in the dimension. The many-ciphertexts version allows us to compute 8192 Softmax of dimension 256 in parallel in 486s (single-thread CPU), corresponding to an amortized 0.06s per Softmax call. All Softmax calls of the 32-layers LLaMa large language model (7B version) with context length 128 on an RTX-6000 GPU take around 1.5 minutes, and the final Softmax call in dimension 32768 for token generation takes less than 3 seconds. This suggests that near-practicality may be accessible with dedicated hardware."

Non-linear regression models, such as Gaussian process regression, are commonly used in causal inference but have limitations due to high costs when adapted for secure computation. Support vector regression (SVR) offers an alternative but remains costly in an Multi-party computation context due to conditional branches and support vector updates.In this paper, we propose Aitia, the first two-party secure computation protocol for bivariate causal discovery.

Intuitively, the backdoor can be purified by re-optimizing the model to smoother minima. However, a na\\\"{\\i}ve adoption of any optimization targeting smoother minima can lead to sub-optimal purification techniques hampering the clean test accuracy. Hence, to effectively obtain such re-optimization, inspired by our novel perspective establishing the connection between backdoor removal and loss smoothness, we propose &lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;isher &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;nformation guided &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;urification (FIP), a novel backdoor purification framework.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks has led to a proliferation of open-sourced task-specific models. Recently, Model Merging (MM) has emerged as an effective approach to facilitate knowledge transfer among these independently fine-tuned models. MM directly combines multiple fine-tuned task-specific models into a merged model without additional training, and the resulting model shows enhanced capabilities in multiple tasks. Although MM provides great utility, it may come with security risks because an adversary can exploit MM to affect multiple downstream tasks. However, the security risks of MM have barely been studied. In this paper, we first find that MM, as a new learning paradigm, introduces unique challenges for existing backdoor attacks due to the merging process. To address these challenges, we introduce BadMerging, the first backdoor attack specifically designed for MM. Notably, BadMerging allows an adversary to compromise the entire merged model by contributing as few as one backdoored task-specific model. BadMerging comprises a two-stage attack mechanism and a novel feature-interpolation-based loss to enhance the robustness of embedded backdoors against the changes of different merging parameters. Considering that a merged model may incorporate tasks from different domains, BadMerging can jointly compromise the tasks provided by the adversary (on-task attack) and other contributors (off-task attack) and solve the corresponding unique challenges with novel attack designs. Extensive experiments show that BadMerging achieves remarkable attacks against various MM algorithms. Our ablation study demonstrates that the proposed attack designs can progressively contribute to the attack performance. Finally, we show that prior defense mechanisms fail to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for more advanced defense.

For example, a trigger of sunglasses could mislead a facial recognition model when either an arbitrary (source-class-agnostic) or a specific (source-class-specific) person wears sunglasses. Existing defense strategiesoverwhelmingly focus on countering VCB attacks, especially those that are source-class-agnostic. This narrow focus neglects the potential threat of other simpler yet general backdoor types, leading to false security implications. It is, therefore, crucial to discover and elucidate unknown backdoor types, particularly those that can be easily implemented, as a mandatory step before developing countermeasures.This study introduces a new, simple, and general type of backdoor attack, the horizontal class backdoor (HCB), that trivially breaches the class dependence characteristic of the VCB, bringing a fresh perspective to the field. An HCB is activated when the trigger is presented together with an innocuous feature,regardless of class. For example, under an HCB, the trigger of sunglasses could mislead a facial recognition model in the presence of the innocuous feature smiling. Smiling is innocuous because it is irrelevant to the main task of facial recognition. The key is that these innocuous features (such as rain, fog, or snow in autonomous driving or facial expressions like smiling or sadness in facial recognition) are horizontally sharedamong classes but are only exhibited by partial samples per class. Extensive experiments on attacking performance across various tasks, including MNIST, facial recognition, traffic sign recognition, object detection, and medical diagnosis, confirm the high efficiency and effectiveness of the HCB. We rigorously evaluated the evasiveness of the HCB against a series of eleven representative countermeasures, including Fine-Pruning (RAID 18'), STRIP (ACSAC 19'), Neural Cleanse (Oakland 19'), ABS (CCS 19'), Februus (ACSAC 20'), NAD (ICLR 21'), MNTD (Oakland 21'), SCAn (USENIX SEC 21'), MOTH (Oakland 22'), Beatrix (NDSS 23'), and MM-BD (Oakland 24'). None of these countermeasures prove robustness, even when employing a simplistic trigger, such as a small and static white-square patch."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models trained on data from potentially untrusted sources are vulnerable to poisoning. A small, maliciously crafted subset of the training inputs can cause the model to learn a \"backdoor\" task (e.g., misclassify inputs with a certain feature) in addition to its main task. Recent research proposed many hypothetical backdoor attacks whose efficacy depends on the configuration and training hyperparameters of the target model. At the same time, state-of-the-art defenses require massive changes to the existing ML pipelines and protect only against some attacks.Given the variety of potential backdoor attacks, ML engineers who are not security experts have no way to measure how vulnerable their current training pipelines are, nor do they have a practical way to compare training configurations so as to pick the more resistant ones. Deploying a defense may not be a realistic option, either. It requires evaluating and choosing from among dozens of research papers, completely re-engineering the pipeline as required by the chosen defense, and then repeating the process if the defense disrupts normal model training (while providing theoretical protection against an unknown subset of hypothetical threats).In this paper, we aim to provide ML engineers with pragmatic tools to audit the backdoor resistance of their training pipelines and to compare different training configurations, to help choose the one that best balances accuracy and security.First, we propose a universal, attack-agnostic resistance metric based on the minimum number of training inputs that must be compromised before the model learns any backdoor.Second, we design, implement, and evaluate Mithridates, a multi-stage approach that integrates backdoor resistance into the training-configuration search. ML developers already rely on hyperparameter search to find configurations that maximize the model's accuracy. Mithridates extends this tool to also order configurations based on their backdoor resistance. We demonstrate that Mithridates discovers configurations whose resistance to multiple types of backdoor attacks increases by 3-5x with only a slight impact on accuracy. We also discuss extensions to AutoML and federated learning."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly deployed in heterogeneous hardware, including high-performance devices like GPUs and low-power devices like mobile/IoT CPUs, FPGAs, and accelerators. In order to unlock the full performance potential of various hardware, deep learning (DL) compilers automatically optimize DNN inference computations and compile DNN models into DNN executables for efficient computations across hardware backends. As valuable intellectual properties, DNN architectures are one primary attack target. Since previous works already demonstrate the abuse of cache side channels to steal DNN architectures from DL frameworks (e.g., PyTorch and TensorFlow), we first study using those known side-channel attacks against DNN executables. We find that attacking DNN executables presents unique challenges, and existing works can hardly apply. Particularly, DNN executables exhibit a standalone paradigm that largely reduces cache side channel attack surfaces. Meanwhile, cache side channels capture only limited behaviors of the whole DNN execution while facing daunting technical challenges (e.g., noise and low time resolution). However, we unveil a unique attack vector in DNN executables, such that the cache-aware optimizations, which are extensively employed by contemporary DL compilers to harvest the full potentials of hardware, would result in distinguishable DNN operator cache access patterns, making model architecture recovery possible. We propose DeepCache, an end-to-end side channel attack framework, to infer DNN model architectures from DNN executables. DeepCache leverages cache side channels as the attacking primitives and combines contrastive learning and anomaly detection to enable precise inference. Our evaluation using the standard Prime+Probe shows that DeepCache yields a high accuracy in exploiting complex DNN executables under both the basic L1 cache attack and the more practical but challenging last level cache (LLC) attack settings."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) based anomaly detection has shown great promise in the field of security due to its remarkable performance in various tasks. However, the issue of poor interpretability in DL models has significantly impeded their deployment in practical security applications. Despite the progress made in existing studies on DL explanations, the majority of them focus on providing local explanations for individual samples, neglecting the global understanding of the model knowledge. Furthermore, most explanations for supervised models fail to apply to anomaly detection due to their different learning mechanisms.In this work, we address the gap in the existing research by proposing GEAD, a novel global explanation for DL-based anomaly detection, to extract high-fidelity rules from DL models. We apply GEAD to two security applications, network intrusion detection and system log anomaly detection, and demonstrate the efficacy with three usages: comparing model knowledge with expert knowledge, identifying knowledge discrepancies between models, and combining model and expert knowledge. We provide several case studies to showcase how GEAD can significantly enhance existing anomaly detection systems. Moreover, we provide a real-world deployment in a SCADA system to showcase the potential in practice. Some important insights are drawn to help the community understand and improve anomaly detection systems in security."

    "abstract": "Control-flow integrity (CFI) is a strong and efficient defense mechanism against memory-corruption attacks. The practical versions of CFI, which have been integrated into compilers, employ static analysis to collect all possibly valid target functions of indirect calls. They are however less effective because the static analysis is imprecise. While more precise CFI techniques have been proposed, such as dynamic CFI, they are not yet practical due to issues on performance, compatibility, and deployability. We believe that to be practical, CFI based on static analysis is still the promising direction. However, these years have not seen much progress on the effectiveness of such practical CFI.This paper aims to boost the effectiveness of practical CFI by dramatically optimizing the target-function sets (aka equivalence class or EC) of indirect calls. We first identify two fundamental limitations that lead to the imprecision of static indirect-call analysis: incomplete field sensitivity due to variable field indexes and the unawareness of the origins of point-to targets. We then propose two novel analysis techniques, complete field sensitivity and origin awareness, which handle variable field indexes and distinguish target origins. The techniques dramatically reduce the size of target functions. To enforce the origin awareness, we further employ Intel Memory Protection Keys to safely store the origin information. We implement our techniques as a system called ECCut. The evaluation results show that compared to the mainline LLVM CFI, ECCut achieves a substantial reduction of 94.8\\% and 90.3\\% in the average and the largest EC sizes. While compared to the state-of-the-art origin-aware CFI (i.e., OS-CFI), ECCut reduces the average and the largest EC sizes by 90.2\\% and 89.3\\% respectively. Additionally, ECCut introduces an acceptable performance overhead (7.2\\% on average) observed across a comprehensive range of C/C++ benchmark tests in SPEC CPU2006, SPEC CPU2017, and six real-world applications."

    "abstract": "PowerShell is a powerful and versatile task automation tool. Unfortunately, it is also widely abused by cyber attackers. To bypass malware detection and hinder threat analysis, attackers often employ diverse techniques to obfuscate malicious PowerShell scripts. Existing deobfuscation tools suffer from the limitation of static analysis, which fails to simulate the real deobfuscation process accurately. Accurate, complete, and robust PowerShell script deobfuscation is still a challenging problem.In this paper, we propose PowerPeeler. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first dynamic PowerShell script deobfuscation approach at the instruction level. It utilizes expression-related Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes to identify potential obfuscated script pieces. Then, PowerPeeler correlates the AST nodes with their corresponding instructions and monitors the script's entire execution process. Subsequently, PowerPeeler dynamically tracks the execution of these instructions and records their execution results. Finally, PowerPeeler stringifies these results to replace the corresponding obfuscated script pieces and reconstruct the deobfuscated script.To evaluate the effectiveness of PowerPeeler, we collect 1,736,669 real-world malicious PowerShell samples and distill two high-quality datasets with diversity obfuscation methods: D-Script with 4,264 obfuscated script files and D-Cmdline with 381 obfuscated samples using PowerShell command-line interface. We compare PowerPeeler with five state-of-the-art deobfuscation tools and GPT-4. The evaluation results demonstrate that PowerPeeler can effectively handle all well-known obfuscation methods. Additionally, the deobfuscation correctness rate of PowerPeeler reaches 95\\%, significantly surpassing that of other tools. PowerPeeler not only recovers the highest amount of sensitive data (e.g., IPs and URLs) but also maintains a semantic consistency over 97\\%, which is also the best. Moreover, PowerPeeler effectively obtains the largest quantity of valid deobfuscated results within a limited time frame (i.e., two minutes). Furthermore, PowerPeeler is extendable and can be used as a helpful tool for other cyber security solutions, such as malware analysis and threat intelligence generation."

    "abstract": "Decompilation aims to recover a binary executable to the source code form and hence has a wide range of applications in cyber security, such as malware analysis and legacy code hardening. A prominent challenge is to recover variable symbols, including both primitive and complex types such as user-defined data structures, along with their symbol information such as names and types. Existing efforts focus on solving parts of the problem, e.g., recovering only types (without names) or only local variables (without user-defined structures). In this paper, we propose ReSym, a novel hybrid technique that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and program analysis to recover both names and types for local variables and user-defined data structures. Our method encompasses fine-tuning two LLMs to handle local variables and structures, respectively. To overcome the token limitations inherent in current LLMs, we devise a novel Prolog-based algorithm to aggregate and cross-check results from multiple LLM queries, suppressing uncertainty and hallucinations. Our experiments show that ReSym is effective in recovering variable information and user-defined data structures, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "A μ-kernel is an operating system (OS) paradigm that facilitates a strong cybersecurity posture for embedded systems. Unlike a monolithic OS such as Linux, a μ-kernel reduces overall system privilege by deploying most OS functionality within isolated, userspace protection domains. Moreover, a μ-kernel ensures confidentiality and integrity between protection domains (i.e., spatial isolation), and offers timing predictability for real-time tasks in mixed-criticality systems (i.e., temporal isolation). One popular μ-kernel is seL4 which offers extensive formal guarantees of implementation correctness and flexible temporal budgeting mechanisms.However, we show that an untrusted protection domain on a μ-kernel can abuse service requests to other protection domains in order to corrode system availability. We generalize this denial-of-service (DoS) attack strategy as Manipulative Interference Attacks (MIAs) and introduce techniques to efficiently identify instances of MIAs within a configured system. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid approach that first leverages static analysis to identify software components with influenceable execution times, and second, uses an automatically generated model-based analysis to determine which compromised protection domains can manipulate the influenceable components and trigger MIAs. We investigate the risk of MIAs in several representative system examples including the seL4 Microkit, as well as a case study of seL4 software artifacts from the DARPA Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program. In particular, we demonstrate that our analysis is efficient enough to discover practical instances of MIAs in real-world systems."

    "abstract": "In kernel, the driver code is much more than the core code, thus having a larger attack surface. Especially for the untrusted drivers without source code, they may come from the hot-plug hardware or the user without security knowledge. Traditional isolation methods require analyzing source code to set checkpoints in the driver for control flow protection, which are not available for closed-source drivers. Evenworse, the existing isolation methods can only prevent the hijacked control flows entering/existing drivers, while they cannot discover the illegal control flows inside drivers. Although the kernel address space location randomization (KASLR) can defend against control flow hijacking, it can be bypassed by code probes. In response to these issues, this paper proposes a novel method Dbox to isolate and detect the untrusted drivers whose source code is unavailable. Dbox creates a light hypervisor to monitor and analyze the untrusted driver's behavior without relying on source code. It isolates the untrusted driver in a private space and dynamically changes its virtual space through a sliding space mechanism. Under the protection of Dbox, all control flows jumping to/from untrusted drivers can be detected. Experiments and analysis show that Dbox has good protection against code probes, kernel rootkits and code reuse attacks, and the overhead introduced to the operating system is less than 3.6\\% in general scenarios."

It is therefore paramount that the we can simplify the design of ABE schemes that are efficient, provide strong security guarantees, minimize the complexity in their descriptions and support all practical features that are desirable for common real-world settings. One of such practical features that is currently still difficult to achieve is multi-authority support. Motivated by NIST's ongoing standardization efforts around multi-authority schemes, we put a specific focus on simplifying the support of multiple authorities in the design of schemes. Abstract: Code to separate paragraphs To this end, we present ISABELLA, a framework for constructing pairing-based ABE with advanced functionalities under strong security guarantees. At a high level, our approach builds on various works that systematically and generically construct ABE schemes by reducing the effort of proving security to a simpler yet powerful ''core'' called pair encodings. To support the amount of adaptivity required by multi-authority ABE, we devise a new approach to designing schemes from pair encodings, while still being able to benefit from the advantages that pair encodings provide. As a direct result of our framework, we obtain various improvements for existing (multi-authority) schemes as well as new schemes."

In addition to the standard public key algorithms (KG, Enc, Dec) for key generation, encryption and decryption, a conditional encryption scheme for a binary predicate P adds a new conditional encryption algorithm CEnc. The conditional encryption algorithm c=CEncpk (c1,m2,m3) takes as input the public encryption key pk, a ciphertext c1 = Encpk (m1) for an unknown message m1, a control message m2 and a payload message m3 and outputs a conditional ciphertext c. Intuitively, if P(m1,m2)=1 then the conditional ciphertext c should decrypt to the payload message m3. On the other hand if P(m1,m2) = 0 then the ciphertext should not leak any information about the control message m2 or the payload message m3 even if the attacker already has the secret decryption key sk. We formalize the notion of conditional encryption secrecy and provide concretely efficient constructions for a set of predicates relevant to password typo correction. Our practical constructions utilize the Paillier partially homomorphic encryption scheme as well as Shamir Secret Sharing. We prove that our constructions are secure and demonstrate how to use conditional encryption to improve the security of personalized password typo correction systems such as TypTop. We implement a C++ library for our practically efficient conditional encryption schemes and evaluate the performance empirically.

To mitigate the potential threats brought by the leakage, much effort has been made to reduce the information leaked by OXT. However, it is still open to achieve encrypted conjunctive search without revealing both KPRP and IP, while preserving high-efficiency.Encrypted multi-map is a crucial primitive for designing searchable encryption with optimal search complexity. In this paper, we present the first non-interactive encrypted conjunctive multi-map, Doris, without KPRP and IP leakage.

Prior state-of-the-art (Hamada et al.[18]) construct an MPC protocol for decision tree training with a communication of O(hmN log N), when building a decision tree of height h for a training dataset of N samples, each having m attributes.In this work, we significantly reduce the communication complexity of secure decision tree training. We construct a protocol with communication complexity O(mN log N + hmN + hN log N), thereby achieving an improvement of ∼ min(h, m, log N) over [18].

The practicality of ABE schemes hinges on the balance between security and efficiency. The state-of-the-art adaptive secure ABE scheme, proven to be adaptively secure under standard assumptions (FAME, CCS'17), is less efficient compared to the fastest one (FABEO, CCS'22) which is only proven secure under the Generic Group Model (GGM). These traditional ABE schemes focus solely on message privacy. To address scenarios where attribute value information is also sensitive, Anonymous ABE (A2BE) ensures the privacy of both the message and attributes. However, most A2BE schemes suffer from intricate designs with low efficiency, and the security of the fastest key-policy A2BE (proposed in FEASE, USENIX'24) relies on the GGM.In this paper, we propose novel fast key-policy and ciphertext-policy ABE schemes that (1) support both AND and OR gates for access policies, (2) have no restriction on the size and type of policies or attributes, (3) achieve adaptive security under the standard DLIN assumption, and (4) only need 4 pairings for decryption. As our ABE constructions automatically provide ciphertext anonymity, we easily transform our ABE schemes to A2BE schemes while maintaining the same features and high-level efficiency.The implementation results show that all our schemes achieve the best efficiency comparing to other schemes with adaptive security proven under standard assumptions. Specifically, our ABE schemes perform better than FAME and are close to FABEO.

    "abstract": "Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) empowers individuals and organizations with full control over their data. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are at its center, where a DID contains a collection of public keys associated with an entity, and further information to enable entities to engage via secure and private messaging across different platforms. A crucial stepping stone is DIDComm, a cryptographic communication layer that is in production with version 2. Due to its widespread and active deployment, a formal study of DIDComm is highly overdue. We present the first formal analysis of DIDComm's cryptography, and formalize its goal of (sender-) anonymity and authenticity. We follow a composable approach to capture its security over a generic network, formulating the goal of DIDComm as a strong ideal communication resource. We prove that the proposed encryption modes reach the expected level of privacy and authenticity, but leak beyond the leakage induced by an underlying network (captured by a parameterizable resource). We further use our formalism to propose enhancements and prove their security: first, we present an optimized algorithm that achieves simultaneously anonymity and authenticity, conforming to the DIDComm message format, and which outperforms the current DIDComm proposal in both ciphertext size and computation time by almost a factor of 2. Second, we present a novel DIDComm mode that fulfills the notion of anonymity preservation, in that it does never leak more than the leakage induced by the network it is executed over. We finally show how to merge this new mode into our improved algorithm, obtaining an efficient all-in-one mode for full anonymity and authenticity."

    "publication": "ACM CCS",
    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3690360",
    "abstract": "The Signal Protocol is a two-party secure messaging protocol used in applications such as Signal, WhatsApp, Google Messages and Facebook Messenger and is used by billions daily. It consists of two core components, one of which is the Double Ratchet protocol that has been the subject of a line of work that aims to understand and formalise exactly what security it provides. Existing models capture strong guarantees including resilience to state exposure in both forward security (protecting past secrets) and post-compromise security (restoring security), adaptive state corruptions, message injections and out-of-order message delivery. Due to this complexity, prior work has failed to provide security guarantees that do not degrade in the number of interactions, even in the single-session setting.Given the ubiquity of the Double Ratchet in practice, we explore tight security bounds for the Double Ratchet in the multi-session setting. To this end, we revisit the modelling of Alwen, Coretti and Dodis (EUROCRYPT 2019) who decompose the protocol into modular, abstract components, notably continuous key agreement (CKA) and forward-secure AEAD (FS-AEAD). To enable a tight security proof, we propose a CKA security model that provides one-way security under key checking attacks. We show that multi-session security of the Double Ratchet can be tightly reduced to the multi-session security of CKA and FS-AEAD, capturing the same strong security guarantees as Alwen et al.Our result improves upon the bounds of Alwen et al. in the random oracle model. Even so, we are unable to provide a completely tight proof for the Double Ratchet based on standard Diffie-Hellman assumptions, and we conjecture it is not possible. We thus go a step further and analyse CKA based on key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). In contrast to previous works, our new analysis allows for tight constructions based on the DDH and post-quantum assumptions."

    "publication": "ACM CCS",
    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3670360",
    "abstract": "The Bluetooth protocol for wireless connection between devices comes with several security measures to protect confidentiality and integrity of data. At the heart of these security protocols lies the Secure Simple Pairing, wherewith the devices can negotiate a shared key before communicating sensitive data. Despite the good intentions, the Bluetooth security protocol has repeatedly been shown to be vulnerable, especially with regard to active attacks on the Secure Simple Pairing.We propose here a mechanism to limit active attacks on the Secure Connections protocol (the more secure version of the Secure Simple Pairing protocol), without infringing on the current Bluetooth protocol stack specification. The idea is to run an authentication protocol, like a classical challenge-response step for certified keys, within the existing infrastructure, even at a later, more convenient point in time. We prove that not only does this authentication step ensure freshness of future encryption keys, but an interesting feature is that it---a posteriori ---also guarantees security of previously derived encryption keys. We next argue that this approach indeed prevents a large set of known attacks on the Bluetooth protocol."

    "abstract": "Leakage-abuse attacks using access pattern leakage from range queries have been shown to reconstruct encrypted databases. However, prior work is either restricted to one-dimensional databases or requires access to all possible responses in two-dimensions. In this paper, we explore what an adversary can achieve with minimal leakage, focusing on denser databases, and present a leakage abuse attack from access pattern of range queries in multiple dimensions. Our attack employs a novel technique to systematically amplify access pattern leakage, inferring a large number of new query responses that have not been requested by the user. Let m be the size of the database domain. Our attack works on d-dimensional databases and achieves approximate reconstruction. For dense databases and a parameter 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1, our attack fully reconstructs an inner portion of size λm of the database (referred to as the λ-core) after observing O(m log m) queries, uniformly at random. These are significant improvements over previous attacks that require the full set of responses, which has size O(m2). We are the first to leverage graph drawing techniques for database reconstruction attacks. We implement our attack and evaluate it with experiments on real-world databases, achieving accurate reconstructions after observing a small percentage of the responses."

    "abstract": "Thanks to recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques, Autonomous Driving (AD) has seen significant breakthroughs with enhanced capabilities. However, the susceptibility of ML models to adversarial evasion attacks poses a critical threat, undermining the reliability of autonomous driving systems. Despite efforts by researchers to mitigate these attacks within the AD context, unfortunately, a significant gap persists in fully understanding such adversarial maneuvers, particularly from a driver's perspective.To bridge this gap, we propose Avara, the first unified evaluation platform for assessing human drivers' perceptibility to adversarial attacks in AD contexts. Leveraging Virtual Reality (VR) and eye-tracking technology, Avara captures multi-modal driver awareness data, enabling detailed assessments of driver perception. Our approach integrates three distinct sources of multi-modal awareness evaluation metrics, addressing gaps inherent in previous evaluation strategies. The effectiveness and usability of Avara were validated through a human subject study, where participants engaged actively with the platform and provided extensive feedback on their perception and response to adversarial evasion attacks. Utilizing Avara, we identify an intriguing discovery that the current imperceptibility metrics for adversarial attacks fail to accurately reflect the autonomous vehicle driver's perceptibility."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexually explicit scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block sexually explicit content (e.g., naked) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts-inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate sexual content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate explicit visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since such unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets and large-scale user studies demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating sexually explicit content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.4\\% sexual content removal performance."

    "publication": "ACM CCS",
    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3670306",
    "abstract": "The advent of generative AI images has completely disrupted the art world. Distinguishing AI generated images from human art is a challenging problem whose impact is growing over time. A failure to address this problem allows bad actors to defraud individuals paying a premium for human art and companies whose stated policies forbid AI imagery. It is also critical for content owners to establish copyright, and for model trainers interested in curating training data in order to avoid potential model collapse.There are several different approaches to distinguishing human art from AI images, including classifiers trained by supervised learning, research tools targeting diffusion models, and identification by professional artists using their knowledge of artistic techniques. In this paper, we seek to understand how well these approaches can perform against today's modern generative models in both benign and adversarial settings. We curate real human art across 7 styles, generate matching images from 5 generative models, and apply 8 detectors (5 automated detectors and 3 different human groups including 180 crowdworkers, 3800+ professional artists, and 13 expert artists experienced at detecting AI). Both Hive and expert artists do very well, but make mistakes in different ways (Hive is weaker against adversarial perturbations while Expert artists produce higher false positives). We believe these weaknesses will persist, and argue that a combination of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), undergo iterative updates to improve image quality and address concerns such as safety. Improvements in image quality are straightforward to assess. However, how model updates resolve existing concerns and whether they raise new questions remain unexplored. This study takes an initial step in investigating the evolution of text-to-image models from the perspectives of safety, bias, and authenticity. Our findings, centered on Stable Diffusion, indicate that model updates paint a mixed picture. While updates progressively reduce the generation of unsafe images, the bias issue, particularly in gender, intensifies. We also find that negative stereotypes either persist within the same Non-White race group or shift towards other Non-White race groups through SD updates, yet with minimal association of these traits with the White race group. Additionally, our evaluation reveals a new concern stemming from SD updates: State-of-the-art fake image detectors, initially trained for earlier SD versions, struggle to identify fake images generated by updated versions. We show that fine-tuning these detectors on fake images generated by updated versions achieves at least 96.6\\% accuracy across various SD versions, addressing this issue. Our insights highlight the importance of continued efforts to mitigate biases and vulnerabilities in evolving text-to-image models."

    "publication": "ACM CCS",
    "paper": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3690297",
    "abstract": "The text-to-image generation model has attracted significant interest from both academic and industrial communities. These models can generate the images based on the given prompt descriptions. Their potent capabilities, while beneficial, also present risks. Previous efforts relied on the approach of training binary classifiers to detect the generated fake images, which is inefficient, lacking in generalizability, and non-robust. In this paper, we propose the novel zero-shot detection method, called ZeroFake, to distinguish fake images apart from real ones by utilizing a perturbation-based DDIM inversion technique. ZeroFake is inspired by the findings that fake images are more robust than real images during the process of DDIM inversion and reconstruction. Specifically, for a given image, ZeroFake first generates noise with DDIM inversion guided by adversary prompts. Then, ZeroFake reconstructs the image from the generated noise. Subsequently, it compares the reconstructed image with the original image to determine whether it is fake or real. By exploiting the differential response of fake and real images to the adversary prompts during the inversion and reconstruction process, our model offers a more robust and efficient method to detect fake images without the extensive data and training costs. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed ZeroFake can achieve great performance in fake image detection, fake artwork detection, and fake edited image detection. We further illustrate the robustness of the proposed ZeroFake by showcasing its resilience against potential adversary attacks. We hope that our solution can better assist the community in achieving the arrival of a more efficient and fair AGI."

    "abstract": "Audio deepfakes are a form of deception where convincing speech sentences are synthesized through machine learning means to give an impression of a human speaker. Audio deepfakes emerge as an attractive vector for targeting users that rely on audio accessibility, such as individuals who are blind or low vision. The critical reliance on speech both as a medium and an affordance puts this population at an undue risk of being deceived as they rely solely on themselves to detect whether a piece of audio is a deepfake or not. To better understand the nature of this risk considering the nuanced reliance on assistive technologies such as screen readers, we conducted a user study with n=16 blind and low vision individuals from the US. Our participants achieved an overall discernment accuracy of 59\\%, and clips identified as deep fakes were only actually deepfakes in 50.8\\% of the cases (precision). The participants that self-identified as \"low vision\" performed slightly better (accuracy of 61\\%, precision of 64\\%) compared to the ones that self-identified as \"blind\" (accuracy of 55\\%, precision of 56\\%). Our qualitative results show that the participants in the \"blind\" group mostly considered a combination of infliction, imperfections in the voice, and the intensity in the speech delivery as discernment factors. The participants in the \"low vision\" group mostly used the speaker's pitch, enunciation, emotion, and the fluency and articulation of the speaker as discernment cues. Overall, participants felt that audio deepfakes have the potential to deceive visually impaired individuals with political disinformation, impersonate their voice in authentication and smart homes, and specifically target them with voice phishing and enhanced scams."
