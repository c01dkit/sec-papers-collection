    "abstract": "Many emerging applications such as IoT, wearables, implantables, and sensor networks are power- and energy-constrained. These applications rely on ultra-low-power processors that have rapidly become the most abundant type of processor manufactured today. In the ultra-low-power embedded systems used by these applications, peak power and energy requirements are the primary factors that determine critical system characteristics, such as size, weight, cost, and lifetime. While the power and energy requirements of these systems tend to be application-specific, conventional techniques for rating peak power and energy cannot accurately bound the power and energy requirements of an application running on a processor, leading to over-provisioning that increases system size and weight. In this paper, we present an automated technique that performs hardware-software co-analysis of the application and ultra-low-power processor in an embedded system to determine application-specific peak power and energy requirements. Our technique provides more accurate, tighter bounds than conventional techniques for determining peak power and energy requirements, reporting 15\\% lower peak power and 17\\% lower peak energy, on average, than a conventional approach based on profiling and guardbanding. Compared to an aggressive stressmark-based approach, our technique reports power and energy bounds that are 26\\% and 26\\% lower, respectively, on average. Also, unlike conventional approaches, our technique reports guaranteed bounds on peak power and energy independent of an application's input set. Tighter bounds on peak power and energy can be exploited to reduce system size, weight, and cost.",

The key challenge is that when applications are co-located on a server, performance interference due to resource contention can be detrimental to the application QoS. Although prior work has proposed techniques to identify \"safe\" co-locations where application QoS is satisfied by predicting the performance interference on multicores, no such prediction technique on accelerators such as GPUs.In this work, we present Prophet, an approach to precisely predict the performance degradation of latency-sensitive applications on accelerators due to application co-location. We analyzed the performance interference on accelerators through a real system investigation and found that unlike on multicores where the key contentious resources are shared caches and main memory bandwidth, the key contentious resources on accelerators are instead processing elements, accelerator memory bandwidth and PCIe bandwidth. Based on this observation, we designed interference models that enable the precise prediction for processing element, accelerator memory bandwidth and PCIe bandwidth contention on real hardware. By using a novel technique to forecast solo-run execution traces of the co-located applications using interference models, Prophet can accurately predict the performance degradation of latency-sensitive applications on non-preemptive accelerators.

They provide high-productivity programming environments featuring high levels of abstraction with powerful built-in functions, automatic memory management, object-oriented programming paradigm and dynamic typing. However, their flexible, dynamic type systems easily become the source of inefficiency in terms of instruction count, memory footprint, and energy consumption. This overhead makes it challenging to deploy these high-productivity programming technologies on emerging single-board computers for IoT applications. Addressing this challenge, this paper introduces Typed Architectures, a high-efficiency, low-cost execution substrate for dynamic scripting languages, where each data variable retains high-level type information at an ISA level. Typed Architectures calculate and check the dynamic type of each variable implicitly in hardware, rather than explicitly in software, hence significantly reducing instruction count for dynamic type checking. Besides, Typed Architectures introduce polymorphic instructions (e.g., xadd), which are bound to the correct native instruction at runtime within the pipeline (e.g., add or fadd) to efficiently implement polymorphic operators. Finally, Typed Architectures provide hardware support for flexible yet efficient type tag extraction and insertion, capturing common data layout patterns of tag-value pairs.

    "abstract": "The slotted-page structure is a database page format commonly used for managing variable-length records. In this work, we develop a novel \"failure-atomic slotted page structure\" for persistent memory that leverages byte addressability and durability of persistent memory to minimize redundant write operations used to maintain consistency in traditional database systems. Failure-atomic slotted paging consists of two key elements: (i) in-place commit per page using hardware transactional memory and (ii) slot header logging that logs the commit mark of each page. The proposed scheme is implemented in SQLite and compared against NVWAL, the current state-of-the-art scheme. Our performance study shows that our failure-atomic slotted paging shows optimal performance for database transactions that insert a single record. For transactions that touch more than one database page, our proposed slot-header logging scheme minimizes the logging overhead by avoiding duplicating pages and logging only the metadata of the dirty pages. Overall, we find that our failure-atomic slotted-page management scheme reduces database logging overhead to 1/6 and improves query response time by up to 33\\% compared to NVWAL.",

In this work, we develop a novel \"failure-atomic slotted page structure\" for persistent memory that leverages byte addressability and durability of persistent memory to minimize redundant write operations used to maintain consistency in traditional database systems.

    "abstract": "Transactional memory (TM) has been the focus of numerous studies, and it is supported in processors such as the IBM Blue Gene/Q and Intel Haswell. Many studies have used the STAMP benchmark suite to evaluate their designs. However, the speedups obtained for the STAMP benchmarks on all TM systems we know of are quite limited; for example, with 64 threads on the IBM Blue Gene/Q, we observe a median speedup of 1.4X using the Blue Gene/Q hardware transactional memory (HTM), and a median speedup of 4.1X using a software transactional memory (STM).What limits the performance of these benchmarks on TMs? In this paper, we argue that the problem lies with the programming model and data structures used to write them. To make this point, we articulate two principles that we believe must be embodied in any scalable program and argue that STAMP programs violate both of them. By modifying the STAMP programs to satisfy both principles, we produce a new set of programs that we call the Stampede suite. Its median speedup on the Blue Gene/Q is 8.0X when using an STM. The two principles also permit us to simplify the TM design. Using this new STM with the Stampede benchmarks, we obtain a median speedup of 17.7X with 64 threads on the Blue Gene/Q and 13.2X with 32 threads on an Intel Westmere system.These results suggest that HTM and STM designs will benefit if more attention is paid to the division of labor between application programs, systems software, and hardware.",

Current verification techniques evaluate segments of the system stack in isolation, such as proving compiler mappings from a high-level language (HLL) to an ISA or proving validity of a microarchitectural implementation of an ISA.This paper makes a case for full-stack MCM verification and provides a toolflow, TriCheck, capable of verifying that the HLL, compiler, ISA, and implementation collectively uphold MCM requirements.

    "abstract": "Building a trustworthy life-critical embedded system requires deep reasoning about the potential effects that sequences of machine instructions can have on full system operation. Rather than trying to analyze complete binaries and the countless ways their instructions can interact with one another --- memory, side effects, control registers, implicit state, etc. --- we explore a new approach. We propose an architecture controlled by a thin computational layer designed to tightly correspond with the lambda calculus, drawing on principles of functional programming to bring the assembly much closer to myriad reasoning frameworks, such as the Coq proof assistant. This approach allows assembly-level verified versions of critical code to operate safely in tandem with arbitrary code, including imperative and unverified system components, without the need for large supporting trusted computing bases. We demonstrate that this computational layer can be built in such a way as to simultaneously provide full programmability and compact, precise, and complete semantics, while still using hardware resources comparable to normal embedded systems. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, our FPGA-implemented prototype runs an embedded medical application which monitors and treats life-threatening arrhythmias. Though the system integrates untrusted and imperative components, our architecture allows for the formal verification of multiple properties of the end-to-end system, including a proof of correctness of the assembly-level implementation of the core algorithm, the integrity of trusted data via a non-interference proof, and a guarantee that our prototype meets critical timing requirements.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous programming model is commonly used in mobile systems and Web 2.0 environments. Asynchronous race detectors use algorithms that are an order of magnitude performance and space inefficient compared to conventional data race detectors. We solve this problem by identifying and addressing two important problems in reasoning about causality between asynchronous events.Unlike conventional signal-wait operations, establishing causal order between two asynchronous events is fundamentally more challenging as there is no common handle they operate on. We propose a new primitive named AsyncClock that addresses this problem by explicitly tracking causally preceding events, and show that AsyncClock can handle a wide variety of asynchronous causality models. We also address the important scalability problem of efficiently identifying heirless events whose metadata can be reclaimed.We built the first single-pass, non-graph-based Android race detector using our algorithm and applied it to find errors in 20 popular applications. Our tool incurs about 6x performance overhead, which is several times more efficient than the state-of-the-art solution. It also scales well with the execution length.

Using NR requires no expertise in concurrent data structure design, and the result is free of concurrency bugs. NR draws ideas from two disciplines: shared-memory algorithms and distributed systems. Briefly, NR implements a NUMA-aware shared log, and then uses the log to replicate data structures consistently across NUMA nodes. NR is best suited for contended data structures, where it can outperform lock-free algorithms by 3.1x, and lock-based solutions by 30x. To show the benefits of NR to a real application, we apply NR to the data structures of Redis, an in-memory storage system. The result outperforms other methods by up to 14x.

In this paper we argue that recovery in distributed asynchronous graph processing does not require the entire execution state to be rolled back to a globally consistent state due to the relaxed asynchronous execution semantics. We define the properties required in the recovered state for it to be usable for correct asynchronous processing and develop CoRAL, a lightweight checkpointing and recovery algorithm. First, this algorithm carries out confined recovery that only rolls back graph execution states of the failed machines to affect recovery. Second, it relies upon lightweight checkpoints that capture locally consistent snapshots with a reduced peak network bandwidth requirement. Our experiments using real-world graphs show that our technique recovers from failures and finishes processing 1.5x to 3.2x faster compared to the traditional asynchronous checkpointing and recovery mechanism when failures impact 1 to 6 machines of a 16 machine cluster.

The trimmed approximation is both safe and profitable, enabling the computation to produce correct results and converge quickly.

In recent years, there has been interest in designing similar transformations that operate on recursive programs, but until now these transformations have only considered simple scenarios: multiple recursions to be fused, or a recursion nested inside a simple loop. This paper develops the first set of scheduling transformations for nested recursions: recursive methods that call other recursive methods. These are the recursive analog to nested loops. We present a transformation called recursion twisting that automatically improves locality at all levels of the memory hierarchy, and show that this transformation can yield substantial performance improvements across several benchmarks that exhibit nested recursion.",

    "abstract": "Cache is designed to exploit locality; however, the role of on-chip L1 data caches on modern GPUs is often awkward. The locality among global memory requests from different SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors) is predominantly harvested by the commonly-shared L2 with long access latency; while the in-core locality, which is crucial for performance delivery, is handled explicitly by user-controlled scratchpad memory. In this work, we disclose another type of data locality that has been long ignored but with performance boosting potential --- the inter-CTA locality. Exploiting such locality is rather challenging due to unclear hardware feasibility, unknown and inaccessible underlying CTA scheduler, and small in-core cache capacity. To address these issues, we first conduct a thorough empirical exploration on various modern GPUs and demonstrate that inter-CTA locality can be harvested, both spatially and temporally, on L1 or L1/Tex unified cache. Through further quantification process, we prove the significance and commonality of such locality among GPU applications, and discuss whether such reuse is exploitable. By leveraging these insights, we propose the concept of CTA-Clustering and its associated software-based techniques to reshape the default CTA scheduling in order to group the CTAs with potential reuse together on the same SM. Our techniques require no hardware modification and can be directly deployed on existing GPUs. In addition, we incorporate these techniques into an integrated framework for automatic inter-CTA locality optimization. We evaluate our techniques using a wide range of popular GPU applications on all modern generations of NVIDIA GPU architectures. The results show that our proposed techniques significantly improve cache performance through reducing L2 cache transactions by 55\\%, 65\\%, 29\\%, 28\\% on average for Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal, respectively, leading to an average of 1.46x, 1.48x, 1.45x, 1.41x (up to 3.8x, 3.6x, 3.1x, 3.3x) performance speedups for applications with algorithm-related inter-CTA reuse.",

    "abstract": "With Solid State Disks (SSDs) offering high degrees of parallelism, SSD controllers place data and direct requests to exploit the maximum offered hardware parallelism. In the quest to maximize parallelism and utilization, sub-requests of a request that are directed to different flash chips by the scheduler can experience differential wait times since their individual queues are not coordinated and load balanced at all times. Since the macro request is considered complete only when its last sub-request completes, some of its sub-requests that complete earlier have to necessarily wait for this last sub-request. This paper opens the door to a new class of schedulers to leverage such slack between sub-requests in order to improve response times. Specifically, the paper presents the design and implementation of a slack-enabled re-ordering scheduler, called Slacker, for sub-requests issued to each flash chip. Layered under a modern SSD request scheduler, Slacker estimates the slack of each incoming sub-request to a flash chip and allows them to jump ahead of existing sub-requests with sufficient slack so as to not detrimentally impact their response times. Slacker is simple to implement and imposes only marginal additions to the hardware. Using a spectrum of 21 workloads with diverse read-write characteristics, we show that Slacker provides as much as 19.5\\%, 13\\% and 14.5\\% improvement in response times, with average improvements of 12\\%, 6.5\\% and 8.5\\%, for write-intensive, read-intensive and read-write balanced workloads, respectively.",

Since the macro request is considered complete only when its last sub-request completes, some of its sub-requests that complete earlier have to necessarily wait for this last sub-request. This paper opens the door to a new class of schedulers to leverage such slack between sub-requests in order to improve response times. Specifically, the paper presents the design and implementation of a slack-enabled re-ordering scheduler, called Slacker, for sub-requests issued to each flash chip. Layered under a modern SSD request scheduler, Slacker estimates the slack of each incoming sub-request to a flash chip and allows them to jump ahead of existing sub-requests with sufficient slack so as to not detrimentally impact their response times. Slacker is simple to implement and imposes only marginal additions to the hardware. Using a spectrum of 21 workloads with diverse read-write characteristics, we show that Slacker provides as much as 19.5\\%, 13\\% and 14.5\\% improvement in response times, with average improvements of 12\\%, 6.5\\% and 8.5\\%, for write-intensive, read-intensive and read-write balanced workloads, respectively.",

Currently, executing the software-based DCNNs requires high-performance servers, restricting the widespread deployment on embedded and mobile IoT devices. To overcome this obstacle, considerable research efforts have been made to develop highly-parallel and specialized DCNN accelerators using GPGPUs, FPGAs or ASICs.Stochastic Computing (SC), which uses a bit-stream to represent a number within [-1, 1] by counting the number of ones in the bit-stream, has high potential for implementing DCNNs with high scalability and ultra-low hardware footprint. Since multiplications and additions can be calculated using AND gates and multiplexers in SC, significant reductions in power (energy) and hardware footprint can be achieved compared to the conventional binary arithmetic implementations. The tremendous savings in power (energy) and hardware resources allow immense design space for enhancing scalability and robustness for hardware DCNNs.This paper presents SC-DCNN, the first comprehensive design and optimization framework of SC-based DCNNs, using a bottom-up approach. We first present the designs of function blocks that perform the basic operations in DCNN, including inner product, pooling, and activation function. Then we propose four designs of feature extraction blocks, which are in charge of extracting features from input feature maps, by connecting different basic function blocks with joint optimization. Moreover, the efficient weight storage methods are proposed to reduce the area and power (energy) consumption. Putting all together, with feature extraction blocks carefully selected, SC-DCNN is holistically optimized to minimize area and power (energy) consumption while maintaining high network accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the LeNet5 implemented in SC-DCNN consumes only 17 mm2 area and 1.53 W power, achieves throughput of 781250 images/s, area efficiency of 45946 images/s/mm2, and energy efficiency of 510734 images/J.",

Pioneer service provider such as AT&amp;T proposes to adopt container in NFV to achieve shorter Virtualized Network Function (VNF) provisioning time and better runtime performance. However, we characterize typical NFV work-loads on the containers and find that the performance is unsatisfactory. We observe that the shared host OS net-work stack is the main bottleneck, where the traffic flow processing involves a large amount of intermediate memory buffers and results in significant last level cache pollution. Existing OS memory allocation policies fail to exploit the locality and data sharing information among buffers. In this paper, we propose NetContainer, a software framework that achieves fine-grained hardware resource management for containerized NFV platform. NetContainer employs a cache access overheads guided page coloring scheme to coordinately address the inter-flow cache access overheads and intra-flow cache access overheads. It maps the memory buffer pages that manifest low cache access overheads (across a flow or among the flows) to the same last level cache partition. NetContainer exploits a footprint theory based method to estimate the cache access overheads and a Min-Cost Max-Flow model to guide the memory buffer mappings. We implement the NetContainer in Linux kernel and extensively evaluate it with real NFV workloads. Exper-imental results show that NetContainer outperforms conventional page coloring-based memory allocator by 48\\% in terms of successful call rate.",

In this paper, we propose NetContainer, a software framework that achieves fine-grained hardware resource management for containerized NFV platform. NetContainer employs a cache access overheads guided page coloring scheme to coordinately address the inter-flow cache access overheads and intra-flow cache access overheads. It maps the memory buffer pages that manifest low cache access overheads (across a flow or among the flows) to the same last level cache partition. NetContainer exploits a footprint theory based method to estimate the cache access overheads and a Min-Cost Max-Flow model to guide the memory buffer mappings. We implement the NetContainer in Linux kernel and extensively evaluate it with real NFV workloads. Exper-imental results show that NetContainer outperforms conventional page coloring-based memory allocator by 48\\% in terms of successful call rate.",

    "abstract": "With exploding traffic stuffing existing network infra-structure, today's telecommunication and cloud service providers resort to Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for greater agility and economics. Pioneer service provider such as AT&amp;T proposes to adopt container in NFV to achieve shorter Virtualized Network Function (VNF) provisioning time and better runtime performance. However, we characterize typical NFV work-loads on the containers and find that the performance is unsatisfactory.

Applications require LDA to handle both large datasets and a large number of topics. Though distributed CPU systems have been used, GPU-based systems have emerged as a promising alternative because of the high computational power and memory bandwidth of GPUs. However, existing GPU-based LDA systems cannot support a large number of topics because they use algorithms on dense data structures whose time and space complexity is linear to the number of topics.In this paper, we propose SaberLDA, a GPU-based LDA system that implements a sparsity-aware algorithm to achieve sublinear time complexity and scales well to learn a large number of topics. To address the challenges introduced by sparsity, we propose a novel data layout, a new warp-based sampling kernel, and an efficient sparse count matrix updating algorithm that improves locality, makes efficient utilization of GPU warps, and reduces memory consumption. Experiments show that SaberLDA can learn from billions-token-scale data with up to 10,000 topics, which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of the previous GPU-based systems.

    "abstract": "Java provides security and robustness by building a high-level security model atop the foundation of memory protection. Unfortunately, any native code linked into a Java program -- including the million lines used to implement the standard library -- is able to bypass both the memory protection and the higher-level policies. We present a hardware-assisted implementation of the Java native code interface, which extends the guarantees required for Java's security model to native code.Our design supports safe direct access to buffers owned by the JVM, including hardware-enforced read-only access where appropriate. We also present Java language syntax to declaratively describe isolated compartments for native code.We show that it is possible to preserve the memory safety and isolation requirements of the Java security model in C code, allowing native code to run in the same process as Java code with the same impact on security as running equivalent Java code. Our approach has a negligible impact on performance, compared with the existing unsafe native code interface. We demonstrate a prototype implementation running on the CHERI microprocessor synthesized in FPGA.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are actively exploring techniques to enforce control-flow integrity (CFI), which restricts program execution to a predefined set of targets for each indirect control transfer to prevent code-reuse attacks. While hardware-assisted CFI enforcement may have the potential for advantages in performance and flexibility over software instrumentation, current hardware-assisted defenses are either incomplete (i.e., do not enforce all control transfers) or less efficient in comparison. We find that the recent introduction of hardware features to log complete control-flow traces, such as Intel Processor Trace (PT), provides an opportunity to explore how efficient and flexible a hardware-assisted CFI enforcement system may become. While Intel PT was designed to aid in offline debugging and failure diagnosis, we explore its effectiveness for online CFI enforcement over unmodified binaries by designing a parallelized method for enforcing various types of CFI policies. We have implemented a prototype called GRIFFIN in the Linux 4.2 kernel that enables complete CFI enforcement over a variety of software, including the Firefox browser and its jitted code. Our experiments show that GRIFFIN can enforce fine-grained CFI policies with shadow stack as recommended by researchers at a performance that is comparable to software-only instrumentation techniques. In addition, we find that alternative logging approaches yield significant performance improvements for trace processing, identifying opportunities for further hardware assistance.",

The resulting interference on shared resources often leads to performance degradation and, more importantly, security vulnerabilities. Interference can leak important information ranging from a service's placement to confidential data, like private keys. We present Bolt, a practical system that accurately detects the type and characteristics of applications sharing a cloud platform based on the interference an adversary sees on shared resources. Bolt leverages online data mining techniques that only require 2-5 seconds for detection. In a multi-user study on EC2, Bolt correctly identifies the characteristics of 385 out of 436 diverse workloads. Extracting this information enables a wide spectrum of previously-impractical cloud attacks, including denial of service attacks (DoS) that increase tail latency by 140x, as well as resource freeing (RFA) and co-residency attacks. Finally, we show that while advanced isolation mechanisms, such as cache partitioning lower detection accuracy, they are insufficient to eliminate these vulnerabilities altogether. To do so, one must either disallow core sharing, or only allow it between threads of the same application, leading to significant inefficiencies and performance penalties.",

This cloud-only approach requires significant amounts of data to be sent to the cloud over the wireless network and puts significant computational pressure on the datacenter. However, as the computational resources in mobile devices become more powerful and energy efficient, questions arise as to whether this cloud-only processing is desirable moving forward, and what are the implications of pushing some or all of this compute to the mobile devices on the edge.In this paper, we examine the status quo approach of cloud-only processing and investigate computation partitioning strategies that effectively leverage both the cycles in the cloud and on the mobile device to achieve low latency, low energy consumption, and high datacenter throughput for this class of intelligent applications. Our study uses 8 intelligent applications spanning computer vision, speech, and natural language domains, all employing state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as the core machine learning technique. We find that given the characteristics of DNN algorithms, a fine-grained, layer-level computation partitioning strategy based on the data and computation variations of each layer within a DNN has significant latency and energy advantages over the status quo approach.Using this insight, we design Neurosurgeon, a lightweight scheduler to automatically partition DNN computation between mobile devices and datacenters at the granularity of neural network layers.

With Castor, developers can leave record and replay on by default, making it practical to record and reproduce production bugs, or employ fault tolerance to recover from hardware failures.Castor is inspired by several observations: First, an efficient mechanism for logging non-deterministic events is critical for recording demanding workloads with low overhead. Through careful use of hardware we were able to increase log throughput by 10x or more, e.g., we could record a server handling 10x more requests per second for the same record overhead. Second, most applications can be recorded without modifying source code by using the compiler to instrument language level sources of non-determinism, in conjunction with more familiar techniques like shared library interposition. Third, while Castor cannot deterministically replay all data races, this limitation is generally unimportant in practice, contrary to what prior work has assumed.Castor currently supports applications written in C, C++, and Go on FreeBSD.

    "abstract": "Data prefetching and cache replacement algorithms have been intensively studied in the design of high performance microprocessors. Typically, the data prefetcher operates in the private caches and does not interact with the replacement policy in the shared Last-Level Cache (LLC). Similarly, most replacement policies do not consider demand and prefetch requests as different types of requests. In particular, program counter (PC)-based replacement policies cannot learn from prefetch requests since the data prefetcher does not generate a PC value. PC-based policies can also be negatively affected by compiler optimizations. In this paper, we propose a holistic cache management technique called Kill-the-PC (KPC) that overcomes the weaknesses of traditional prefetching and replacement policy algorithms. KPC cache management has three novel contributions. First, a prefetcher which approximates the future use distance of prefetch requests based on its prediction confidence. Second, a simple replacement policy provides similar or better performance than current state-of-the-art PC-based prediction using global hysteresis. Third, KPC integrates prefetching and replacement policy into a whole system which is greater than the sum of its parts. Information from the prefetcher is used to improve the performance of the replacement policy and vice-versa. Finally, KPC removes the need to propagate the PC through entire on-chip cache hierarchy while providing a holistic cache management approach with better performance than state-of-the-art PC-, and non-PC-based schemes.

    "abstract": "NUMA (non-uniform memory access) servers are commonly used in high-performance computing and datacenters. Within each server, a processor-interconnect (e.g., Intel QPI, AMD HyperTransport) is used to communicate between the different sockets or nodes. In this work, we explore the impact of the processor-interconnect on overall performance -- in particular, the performance un- fairness caused by processor-interconnect arbitration. It is well known that locally-fair arbitration does not guarantee globally-fair bandwidth sharing as closer nodes receive more bandwidth in a multi-hop network. However, this work demonstrates that the opposite can occur in a commodity NUMA server where remote nodes receive higher bandwidth (and perform better). We analyze this problem and iden- tify that this occurs because of external concentration used in router micro-architectures for processor-interconnects without globally-aware arbitration. While accessing remote memory can occur in any NUMA system, performance un- fairness (or performance variation) is more critical in cloud computing and virtual machines with shared resources. We demonstrate how this unfairness creates significant performance variation when a workload is executed on the Xen virtualization platform. We then provide analysis using synthetic workloads to better understand the source of unfair- ness and eliminate the impact of other shared resources, including the shared last-level cache and main memory. To provide fairness, we propose a novel, history-based arbitration that tracks the history of arbitration grants made in the previous history window. A weighted arbitration is done based on the history to provide global fairness. Through simulations, we show our proposed history-based arbitration can provide global fairness and minimize the processor- interconnect performance unfairness at low cost.",

    "abstract": "NUMA (non-uniform memory access) servers are commonly used in high-performance computing and datacenters. Within each server, a processor-interconnect (e.g., Intel QPI, AMD HyperTransport) is used to communicate between the different sockets or nodes. In this work, we explore the impact of the processor-interconnect on overall performance -- in particular, the performance un- fairness caused by processor-interconnect arbitration. It is well known that locally-fair arbitration does not guarantee globally-fair bandwidth sharing as closer nodes receive more bandwidth in a multi-hop network. However, this work demonstrates that the opposite can occur in a commodity NUMA server where remote nodes receive higher bandwidth (and perform better). We analyze this problem and iden- tify that this occurs because of external concentration used in router micro-architectures for processor-interconnects without globally-aware arbitration. While accessing remote memory can occur in any NUMA system, performance un- fairness (or performance variation) is more critical in cloud computing and virtual machines with shared resources. We demonstrate how this unfairness creates significant performance variation when a workload is executed on the Xen virtualization platform. We then provide analysis using synthetic workloads to better understand the source of unfair- ness and eliminate the impact of other shared resources, including the shared last-level cache and main memory. To provide fairness, we propose a novel, history-based arbitration that tracks the history of arbitration grants made in the previous history window. A weighted arbitration is done based on the history to provide global fairness. Through simulations, we show our proposed history-based arbitration can provide global fairness and minimize the processor- interconnect performance unfairness at low cost.",

    "abstract": "Distributed transactional storage is an important service in today's data centers. Achieving high performance without high complexity is often a challenge for these systems due to sophisticated consistency protocols and multiple layers of abstraction. In this paper we show how to combine two emerging technologies---Software-Defined Flash (SDF) and precise synchronized clocks---to improve performance and reduce complexity for transactional storage within the data center.We present a distributed transactional system (called MILANA) as a layer above a durable multi-version key-value store (called SEMEL) for read-heavy workloads within a data center. SEMEL exploits write behavior of SSDs to maintain a time-ordered sequence of versions for each key efficiently and durably. MILANA adds a variant of optimistic concurrency control above SEMEL's API to service read requests from a consistent snapshot and to enable clients to make fast local commit or abort decisions for read-only transactions.Experiments with the prototype reveal up to 43\\% lower transaction abort rates using IEEE Precision Time Protocol (PTP) vs. the standard Network Time Protocol (NTP). Under the Retwis benchmark, client-local validation of read-only transactions yields a 35\\% reduction in latency and 55\\% increase in transaction throughput.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of programmable network devices and the increasing data traffic of datacenters motivate the idea of in-network computation. By offloading compute operations onto intermediate networking devices (e.g., switches, network accelerators, middleboxes), one can (1) serve network requests on the fly with low latency; (2) reduce datacenter traffic and mitigate network congestion; and (3) save energy by running servers in a low-power mode. However, since (1) existing switch technology doesn't provide general computing capabilities, and (2) commodity datacenter networks are complex (e.g., hierarchical fat-tree topologies, multipath communication), enabling in-network computation inside a datacenter is challenging.In this paper, as a step towards in-network computing, we present IncBricks, an in-network caching fabric with basic computing primitives. IncBricks is a hardware-software co-designed system that supports caching in the network using a programmable network middlebox. As a key-value store accelerator, our prototype lowers request latency by over 30\\% and doubles throughput for 1024 byte values in a common cluster configuration.
