    "abstract": "How will people, other species, software and hardware live together in as yet unknown futures? How can we work towards trusted and safe futures where human values and the environment are supported by emerging technologies? Research demonstrates that human values and everyday life priorities, ethics, routines and activities will shape our possible futures. I will draw on ethnographic research to outline how people anticipate and imagine everyday life futures with emerging technologies in their homes and neighbourhoods, and how technology workers envisage futures in their professional lives. If, as social science research shows, technologies cannot solve human and societal problems, what roles should they play in future life? What are the implications for future software? What values should underpin its design? Where should it be developed? By and in collaboration with whom? What role can software play in generating the circumstances for trusted futures?"

Hence, they are increasingly integrated into sophisticated software systems, some of which (e.g., autonomous vehicles) are required to deliver certified dependability warranties. In this talk, I will consider the unique features of AI based systems and of the faults possibly affecting them, in order to revise the testing fundamentals and redefine the overall goal of testing, taking a statistical view on the dependability warranties that can be actually delivered. Then, I will consider the key elements of a revised testing process for AI based systems, including the test oracle and the test input generation problems. I will also introduce the notion of runtime supervision, to deal with unexpected error conditions that may occur in the field. Finally, I will identify the future steps that are essential to close the loop from testing to operation, proposing an empirical framework that reconnects the output of testing to its original goals."

    "abstract": "From humanity's existential risks to safety risks in critical systems to ethical risks, responsible AI, as the saviour, has become a major research challenge with significant real-world consequences. However, achieving responsible AI remains elusive despite the plethora of high-level ethical principles, risk frameworks and progress in algorithmic assurance. In the meantime, software engineering (SE) is being upended by AI, grappling with building system-level quality and alignment from inscrutable machine learning models and code generated from natural language prompts. The upending poses new challenges and opportunities for engineering AI systems responsibly. This talk will share our experiences in helping the industry achieve responsible AI systems by inventing new SE approaches. It will dive into industry challenges (such as risk silos and principle-algorithm gaps) and research challenges (such as lack of requirements, emerging properties and inscrutable systems) and make the point that SE is the linchpin of responsible AI. But SE also requires some fundamental rethinking - shifting from building functions into AI systems to discovering and managing emerging functions from AI systems. Only by doing so can SE take on critical new roles, from understanding human intelligence to building a thriving human-AI symbiosis."

    "abstract": "As pre-trained models automate many code intel-ligence tasks, a widely used paradigm is to fine-tune a model on the task dataset for each programming language. A recent study reported that multilingual fine-tuning benefits a range of tasks and models. However, we find that multilingual fine-tuning leads to performance degradation on recent models UniXcoder and CodeT5. To alleviate the potentially catastrophic forgetting issue in multilingual models, we fix all pre-trained model parameters, insert the parameter-efficient structure adapter, and fine-tune it. Updating only 0.6% of the overall parameters compared to full-model fine-tuning for each programming language, adapter tuning yields consistent improvements on code search and sum-marization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we experimentally show its effectiveness in cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios. Multilingual fine-tuning with 200 samples per programming language approaches the results fine-tuned with the entire dataset on code summarization. Our experiments on three probing tasks show that adapter tuning significantly outperforms full-model fine-tuning and effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting."

    "abstract": "Representing code changes as numeric feature vectors, i.e., code change representations, is usually an essential step to automate many software engineering tasks related to code changes, e.g., commit message generation and just-in-time defect prediction. Intuitively, the quality of code change representations is crucial for the effectiveness of automated approaches. Prior work on code changes usually designs and evaluates code change representation approaches for a specific task, and little work has investigated code change encoders that can be used and jointly trained on various tasks. To fill this gap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approach named CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors for diverse downstream tasks. Specifically, CCRep regards a code change as the combination of its before-change and after-change code, leverages a pre-trained code model to obtain high-quality contextual embeddings of code, and uses a novel mechanism named query back to extract and encode the changed code fragments and make them explicitly interact with the whole code change. To evaluate CCRep and demonstrate its applicability to diverse code-change-related tasks, we apply it to three tasks: commit message generation, patch correctness assessment, and just-in-time defect prediction. Experimental results show that CCRep outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques on each task."

    "abstract": "Previous research on code intelligence usually trains a deep learning model on a fixed dataset in an offline manner. However, in real-world scenarios, new code repositories emerge incessantly, and the carried new knowledge is beneficial for providing up-to-date code intelligence services to developers. In this paper, we aim at the following problem: How to enable code intelligence models to continually learn from ever-increasing data? One major challenge here is catastrophic forgetting, meaning that the model can easily forget knowledge learned from previous datasets when learning from the new dataset. To tackle this challenge, we propose REPEAT, a novel method for continual learning of code intelligence models. Specifically, REPEAT addresses the catastrophic forgetting problem with representative exemplars replay and adaptive parameter regularization. The representative exemplars replay component selects informative and diverse exemplars in each dataset and uses them to re-train model periodically. The adaptive parameter regularization component recognizes important parameters in the model and adaptively penalizes their changes to preserve the knowledge learned before. We evaluate the proposed approach on three code intelligence tasks including code summarization, software vulnerability detection, and code clone detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REPEAT consistently outperforms baseline methods on all tasks. For example, REPEAT improves the conventional fine-tuning method by 1.22, 5.61, and 1.72 on code summarization, vulnerability detection and clone detection, respectively."

    "abstract": "Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the fundamental software system that supports the interpretation and execution of Java bytecode. To support the surging performance demands for the increasingly complex and large-scale Java programs, Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler was proposed to perform sophisticated runtime optimization. However, this inevitably induces various bugs, which are becoming more pervasive over the decades and can often cause significant consequences. To facilitate the design of effective and efficient testing techniques to detect JIT compiler bugs. This study first performs a preliminary study aiming to understand the characteristics of JIT compiler bugs and the corresponding triggering test cases. Inspired by the empirical findings, we propose JOpFuzzer, a new JVM testing approach with a specific focus on JIT compiler bugs. The main novelty of JOpFuzzer is embodied in three aspects. First, besides generating new seeds, JOpFuzzer also searches for diverse configurations along the new dimension of optimization options. Second, JOpFuzzer learns the correlations between various code features and different optimization options to guide the process of seed mutation and option exploration. Third, it leverages the profile data, which can reveal the program execution information, to guide the fuzzing process. Such nov-elties enable JOpFuzzer to effectively and efficiently explore the two-dimensional input spaces. Extensive evaluation shows that JOpFuzzer outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the achieved code coverages. More importantly, it has detected 41 bugs in OpenJDK, and 25 of them have already been confirmed or fixed by the corresponding developers."

    "abstract": "As a widely-used platform to support various Java-bytecode-based applications, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) incurs severe performance loss caused by its real-time program interpretation mechanism. To tackle this issue, the Just-in- Time compiler (JIT) has been widely adopted to strengthen the efficacy of JVM. Therefore, how to effectively and efficiently detect JIT bugs becomes critical to ensure the correctness of JVM. In this paper, we propose a coverage-guided fuzzing framework, namely JITfuzz, to automatically detect JIT bugs. In particular, JITfuzz adopts a set of optimization-activating mutators to trigger the usage of typical JIT optimizations, e.g., function inlining and simplification. Meanwhile, given JIT optimizations are closely coupled with program control flows, JITfuzz also adopts mutators to enrich the control flows of target programs. Moreover, JITfuzz also proposes a mutator scheduler which iteratively schedules mutators according to the coverage updates to maximize the code coverage of JIT. To evaluate the effectiveness of JITfuzz, we conduct a set of experiments based on a benchmark suite with 16 popular JVM-based projects from GitHub. The experimental results suggest that JITfuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art mutation-based and generation-based JVM fuzzers by 27.9 % and 18.6 % respectively in terms of edge coverage on average. Furthermore, JITfuzz also successfully detects 36 previously unknown bugs (including 23 JIT bugs) and 27 bugs (including 18 JIT bugs) have been confirmed by the developers."

    "abstract": "SMT solvers check the satisfiability of logic formulas over first-order theories, which have been utilized in a rich number of critical applications, such as software verification, test case generation, and program synthesis. Bugs hidden in SMT solvers would severely mislead those applications and further cause severe consequences. Therefore, ensuring the reliability and robustness of SMT solvers is of critical importance. Although many approaches have been proposed to test SMT solvers, it is still a challenge to discover bugs effectively. To tackle such a challenge, we conduct an empirical study on the historical bug-triggering formulas in SMT solvers' bug tracking systems. We observe that the historical bug-triggering formulas contain valuable skeletons (i.e., core structures of formulas) as well as associated atomic formulas which can cast significant impacts on formulas' ability in triggering bugs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that utilizes the skeletons extracted from the historical bug-triggering formulas and enumerates atomic formulas under the guidance of association rules derived from historical formulas. In this study, we realized our approach as a practical fuzzing tool HistFuzz and conducted extensive testing on the well-known SMT solvers Z3 and cvc5. To date, HistFuzz has found 111 confirmed new bugs for Z3 and cvc5, of which 108 have been fixed by the developers. More notably, out of the confirmed bugs, 23 are soundness bugs and invalid model bugs found in the solvers' default mode, which are essential for SMT solvers. In addition, our experiments also demonstrate that HistFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art SMT solver fuzzers in terms of achieved code coverage and effectiveness."

To enhance the diversity of the found regression faults, DRFuzz proposes a diversity-oriented test criterion to explore as many faulty behaviors as possible. Then, DRFuzz incorporates the GAN model to guarantee the fidelity of generated test inputs. We conduct an extensive study on four subjects in four regression scenarios of DL systems. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DRFuzz over the two compared state-of-the-art approaches, with an average improvement of 1,177% and 539% in terms of the number of detected regression faults."

Unfortunately, due to the absence or incompleteness of documentation and the lack of sufficient samples, automatic type reasoning for binding call parameters is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel operand-variation-oriented differential analysis approach, which automatically extracts features from execution traces as oracles for inferring parameter types. In particular, the parameter types of a binding call are inferred by executing the binding call with different values of different types and investigating which types cause an expected effect on the instruction operands. The inferred type information is used to guide the test generation in fuzzing. Through the evaluation on two popular PDF readers (Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader), we demonstrated the accuracy of our type reasoning method and the effectiveness of the inferred type information for improving fuzzing in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery. We found 38 previously unknown security vulnerabilities, 26 of which were certified with CVE numbers."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172813",
    "abstract": "Refactoring is a common software maintenance practice. The literature defines standard code modifications for each refactoring type and popular IDEs provide refactoring tools aiming to support these standard modifications. However, previous studies indicated that developers either frequently avoid using these tools or end up modifying and even reversing the code automatically refactored by IDEs. Thus, developers are forced to manually apply refactorings, which is cumbersome and error-prone. This means that refactoring support may not be entirely aligned with practical needs. The improvement of tooling support for refactoring in practice requires understanding in what ways developers tailor refactoring modifications. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis of 1,162 refactorings composed of more than 100k program modifications from 13 software projects. The results reveal that developers recurrently apply patterns of additional modifications along with the standard ones, from here on called patterns of customized refactorings. For instance, we found customized refactorings in 80.77% of the Move Method instances observed in the software projects. We also investigated the features of refactoring tools in popular IDEs and observed that most of the customization patterns are not fully supported by them. Additionally, to understand the relevance of these customizations, we conducted a survey with 40 developers about the most frequent customization patterns we found. Developers confirm the relevance of customization patterns and agree that improvements in IDE's refactoring support are needed. These observations highlight that refactoring guidelines must be updated to reflect typical refactoring customizations. Also, IDE builders can use our results as a basis to enable a more flexible application of automated refactorings. For example, developers should be able to choose which method must handle exceptions when extracting an exception code into a new method."

These data-driven solutions are enabled by large software vulnerability datasets used for training and benchmarking. However, we observe that the quality of the data powering these solutions is currently ill-considered, hindering the reliability and value of produced outcomes. Whilst awareness of software vulnerability data preparation challenges is growing, there has been little investigation into the potential negative impacts of software vulnerability data quality. For instance, we lack confirmation that vulnerability labels are correct or consistent. Our study seeks to address such shortcomings by inspecting five inherent data quality attributes for four state-of-the-art software vulnerability datasets and the subsequent impacts that issues can have on software vulnerability prediction models. Surprisingly, we found that all the analyzed datasets exhibit some data quality problems. In particular, we found 20–71% of vulnerability labels to be inaccurate in real-world datasets, and 17-99% of data points were duplicated. We observed that these issues could cause significant impacts on downstream models, either preventing effective model training or inflating benchmark performance. We advocate for the need to overcome such challenges. Our findings will enable better consideration and assessment of software vulnerability data quality in the future."

    "abstract": "In collaborative software development, multiple contributors frequently change the source code in parallel to implement new features, fix bugs, refactor existing code, and make other changes. These simultaneous changes need to be merged into the same version of the source code. However, the merge operation can fail, and developer intervention is required to resolve the conflicts. Studies in the literature show that 10 to 20 percent of all merge attempts result in conflicts, which require the manual developer's intervention to complete the process. In this paper, we concern about a specific type of change that affects the structure of the source code and has the potential to increase the merge effort: code refactorings. We analyze the relationship between the occurrence of refactorings and the merge effort. To do so, we applied a data mining technique called association rule extraction to find patterns of behavior that allow us to analyze the influence of refactorings on the merge effort. Our experiments extracted association rules from 40,248 merge commits that occurred in 28 popular open-source projects. The results indicate that: (i) the occurrence of refactorings increases the chances of having merge effort; (ii) the more refactorings, the greater the chances of effort; (iii) the more refactorings, the greater the effort; and (iv) parallel refactorings increase even more the chances of having effort, as well as the intensity of it. The results obtained may suggest behavioral changes in the way refactorings are implemented by developer teams. In addition, they can indicate possible ways to improve tools that support code merging and those that recommend refactorings, considering the number of refactorings and merge effort attributes."

To adapt for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, pre-trained models are often processed to enhance their efficiency and compactness, using optimization techniques such as pruning and quantization. Similar to the optimization process in other complex systems, e.g., program compilers and databases, optimizations for ML models can contain bugs, leading to severe consequences such as system crashes and financial loss. While bugs in training, compiling and deployment stages have been extensively studied, there is still a lack of systematic understanding and characterization of model optimization bugs (MOBs). In this work, we conduct the first empirical study to identify and characterize MOBs. We collect a comprehensive dataset containing 371 MOBs from TensorFlow and PyTorch, the most extensively used open-source ML frameworks, covering the entire development time span of their optimizers (May 2019 to August 2022). We then investigate the collected bugs from various perspectives, including their symptoms, root causes, life cycles, detection and fixes. Our work unveils the status quo of MOBs in the wild, and reveals their features on which future detection techniques can be based. Our findings also serve as a warning to the developers and the users of ML frameworks, and an appeal to our research community to enact dedicated countermeasures."

    "abstract": "Much research on automated program debugging often assumes that bug fix location(s) indicate the faults' root causes and that root causes of faults lie within single code elements (statements). It is also often assumed that the number of statements a developer would need to inspect before finding the first faulty statement reflects debugging effort. Although intuitive, these three assumptions are typically used (55% of experiments in surveyed publications make at least one of these three assumptions) without any consideration of their effects on the debugger's effectiveness and potential impact on developers in practice. To deal with this issue, we perform controlled experimentation, split testing in particular, using 352 bugs from 46 open-source C programs, 19 Automated Fault Localization (AFL) techniques (18 statistical debugging formulas and dynamic slicing), two (2) state-of-the-art automated program repair (APR) techniques (GenProg and Angelix) and 76 professional developers. Our results show that these assumptions conceal the difficulty of debugging. They make AFL techniques appear to be (up to 38%) more effective, and make APR tools appear to be (2X) less effective. We also find that most developers (83%) consider these assumptions to be unsuitable for debuggers and, perhaps worse, that they may inhibit development productivity. The majority (66%) of developers prefer debugging diagnoses without these assumptions twice as much as with the assumptions. Our findings motivate the need to assess debuggers conservatively, i.e., without these assumptions."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172816",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries. The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce lots of unexpected post-release crashes. Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform application-level call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods. However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records, and some of them only focus on specific manually modeled exception types. To achieve effective debugging on complex framework-specific crashes, we propose a code-separation-based locating approach that weakly relies on CG tracing and does not require any prior knowledge. Our key insight is that one crash trace with the description message can be mapped to a definite exception-thrown point in the framework, the semantics analysis of which can help to figure out the root causes of the crash-triggering procedure. Thus, we can pre-construct reusable summaries for all the framework-specific exceptions to support fault localization in application code. Based on that idea, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes both the key variables and key APIs related to the exception triggering. Then, we perform static analysis to automatically compute such summaries and make a data-tracking of key variables and APIs in the application code to get the ranked buggy candidates. In the scenario of locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, our tool CrashTracker exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 and outperforms the state-of-the-art tool Anchor with higher precision. It only provides a compact candidate set and gives user-friendly reports with explainable reasons for each candidate."

In this paper, to solve the CPF report trilemma, we developed PExReport, which automatically creates stand-alone executable CPF reports. PExReport leverages build tools to prune source code and dependencies, and further analyzes the build process to create a pruned build environment for reproducing the CPF. We performed an evaluation on 74 software project issues with 198 CPFs, and the evaluation results show that PExReport can create executable CPF reports for 184 out of 198 test failures in our dataset, with an average reduction of 72.97% on source classes and the classes in internal JARs."

    "abstract": "A large number of bug reports are created during the evolution of a software system. Locating the source code files that need to be changed in order to fix these bugs is a challenging task. Information retrieval-based bug localization techniques do so by correlating bug reports with historical information about the source code (e.g., previously resolved bug reports, commit logs). These techniques have shown to be efficient and easy to use. However, one flaw that is nearly omnipresent in all these techniques is that they ignore code refactorings. Code refactorings are common during software system evolution, but from the perspective of typical version control systems, they break the code history. For example, a class when renamed then appears as two separate classes with separate histories. Obviously, this is a problem that affects any technique that leverages code history. This paper proposes a refactoring-aware traceability model to keep track of the code evolution history. With this model, we reconstruct the code history by analyzing the impact of code refactorings to correctly stitch together what would otherwise be a fragmented history. To demonstrate that a refactoring aware history is indeed beneficial, we investigated three widely adopted bug localization techniques that make use of code history, which are important components in existing approaches. Our evaluation on 11 open source projects shows that taking code refactorings into account significantly improves the results of these bug localization techniques without significant changes to the techniques themselves. The more refactorings are used in a project, the stronger the benefit we observed. Based on our findings, we believe that much of the state of the art leveraging code history should benefit from our work."

As such, integrating formal methods into software has been associated with numerous challenges. While educators have placed emphasis on formalisms in undergraduate theory courses, such courses often struggle with poor student outcomes and satisfaction. In this paper, we present a controlled eye-tracking human study (n = 34) investigating the problem-solving strategies employed by students with different levels of incoming preparation (as assessed by theory coursework taken and pre-screening performance on a proof comprehension task), and how educators can better prepare low-outcome students for the rigorous logical reasoning that is a core part of formal methods in software engineering. Surprisingly, we find that incoming preparation is not a good predictor of student outcomes for formalism comprehension tasks, and that student self-reports are not accurate at identifying factors associated with high outcomes for such tasks. Instead, and importantly, we find that differences in outcomes can be attributed to performance for proofs by induction and recursive algorithms, and that better-performing students exhibit significantly more attention switching behaviors, a result that has several implications for pedagogy in terms of the design of teaching materials. Our results suggest the need for a substantial pedagogical intervention in core theory courses to better align student outcomes with the objectives of mastery and retaining the material, and thus bettering preparing students for high-assurance software engineering."

    "abstract": "Specifications for reactive systems synthesis consist of assumptions and guarantees. However, some specifications may include unnecessary assumptions, i.e., assumptions that are not necessary for realizability. While the controllers that are synthesized from such specifications are correct, they are also inflexible and fragile; their executions will satisfy the specification's guarantees in only very specific environments. In this work we show how to detect unnecessary assumptions, and to transform any realizable specification into a corresponding realizable core specification, one that includes the same guarantees but no unnecessary assumptions. We do this by computing an assumptions core, a locally minimal subset of assumptions that suffices for realizability. Controllers that are synthesized from a core specification are not only correct but, importantly, more general; their executions will satisfy the specification's guarantees in more environments. We implemented our ideas in the Spectra synthesis environment, and evaluated their impact over different benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation provides evidence for the motivation and significance of our work, by showing (1) that unnecessary assumptions are highly prevalent, (2) that in almost all cases the fully-automated removal of unnecessary assumptions pays off in total synthesis time, and (3) that core specifications induce more general controllers whose reachable state space is larger but whose representation more memory efficient."

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that developers hesitate to update dependencies and mistrust automated approaches such as Dependabot, since they are afraid of introducing incompatibilities that break their project. In fact, such approaches only suggest naïve updates for a single outdated library but do not ensure compatibility with other dependent libraries in the project. To alleviate this situation and support developers in finding updates with minimal incompatibilities, we present UPCY. UPCY applies the min-(s,t)-cut algorithm and leverages a graph database of Maven Central to identify a list of valid update steps to update a dependency to a target version while minimizing incompatibilities with other libraries. By executing 29,698 updates in 380 projects, we compare the effectiveness of UPCY with the naïve updates applied by state-of-the-art tools. We find that in 41.1% of the cases where the naïve approach fails UPCY generates updates with fewer incompatibilities, and even 70.1% of the generated updates have zero incompatibilities."

    "abstract": "Using API should follow its specifications. Otherwise, it can bring security impacts while the functionality is damaged. To detect API misuse, we need to know what its specifications are. In addition to being provided manually, current tools usually mine the majority usage in the existing codebase as specifications, or capture specifications from its relevant texts in human language. However, the former depends on the quality of the codebase itself, while the latter is limited to the irregularity of the text. In this work, we observe that the information carried by code and documents can complement each other. To mitigate the demand for a high-quality codebase and reduce the pressure to capture valid information from texts, we present APICAD to detect API misuse bugs of C/C++ by combining the specifications mined from code and documents. On the one hand, we effectively build the contexts for API invocations and mine specifications from them through a frequency-based method. On the other hand, we acquire the specifications from documents by using lightweight keyword-based and NLP-assisted techniques. Finally, the combined specifications are generated for bug detection. Experiments show that APICAD can handle diverse API usage semantics to deal with different types of API misuse bugs. With the help of APICAD, we report 153 new bugs in Curl, Httpd, OpenSSL and Linux kernel, 145 of which have been confirmed and 126 have applied our patches."

    "abstract": "Android API-related compatibility issues have be-come a severe problem and significant challenge for app devel-opers due to the well-known Android fragmentation issues. To address this problem, many effective approaches such as app-based and API lifetime-based methods have been proposed to identify incompatible API usages. However, due to the various implementations of API usages and different API invoking paths, there is still a significant weakness of existing approaches, i.e., introducing a massive number of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). To this end, in this paper, we propose PSDroid, an automated compatibility detection approach for Android apps, which aims to reduce FPs and FNs by overcoming several technical bottlenecks. Firstly, we make substantial efforts to carry out a preliminary study to summarize a set of novel API usages with diverse checking implementations. Secondly, we construct a refined API lifetime database by leveraging a semantic resolving analysis on all existing Android SDK frameworks. Based on the above two key phases, we design and implement a novel path-sensitive semantic approach to effectively and automatically detect incompatibility issues. To demonstrate the performance, we compared with five existing approaches (i.e., FicFinder, ACRYL, CIDER, IctAPIFinder, and CID) and the results show that PSDroid outperforms existing tools. We also conducted an in-depth root cause analysis to comprehensively explain the ability of PSDroid in reducing FPs and FNs. Finally, 18/30 reported issues have been confirmed and further fixed by app developers."

However, the massive using TPLs also brings security threats since TPLs may introduce bugs and vulnerabilities. Therefore, software composition analysis (SCA) tools have been proposed to detect and manage TPL usage. Unfortunately, due to the presence of common and trivial functions in the bloated feature dataset, existing tools fail to precisely and rapidly identify TPLs in C/C++ real-world projects. To this end, we propose OSSFP, a novel SCA framework for effective and efficient TPL detection in large-scale real-world projects via generating unique fingerprints for open source software. By removing common and trivial functions and keeping only the core functions to build the fingerprint index for each TPL project, OSSFP significantly reduces the database size and accelerates the detection process. It also improves TPL detection accuracy since noises are excluded from the fingerprints. We applied OSSFP on a large data set containing 23,427 C/C++ repositories, which included 585,683 versions and 90 billion lines of code. The result showed that it could achieve 90.84% of recall and 90.34% of precision, which outperformed the state-of-the-art tool by 35.31% and 3.71%, respectively. OSSFP took only 0.12 seconds on average to identify all TPLs per project, which was 22 times faster than the other tool. OSSFP has proven to be highly scalable on large-scale datasets."

    "abstract": "A smart contract is a self-executing program on a blockchain to ensure an immutable and transparent agreement without the involvement of intermediaries. Despite its growing popularity for many blockchain platforms like Ethereum, no technical means is available even when a smart contract requires to be protected from being copied. One promising direction to claim a software ownership is software watermarking. However, applying existing software watermarking techniques is challenging because of the unique properties of a smart contract, such as a code size constraint, non-free execution cost, and no support for dynamic allocation under a virtual machine environment. This paper introduces a novel software watermarking scheme, dubbed Smartmark, aiming to protect the ownership of a smart contract against a pirate activity. Smartmark builds the control flow graph of a target contract runtime bytecode, and locates a collection of bytes that are randomly elected for representing a watermark. We implement a full-fledged prototype for Ethereum, applying Smartmark to 27,824 unique smart contract bytecodes. Our empirical results demonstrate that Smartmark can effectively embed a watermark into a smart contract and verify its presence, meeting the requirements of credibility and imperceptibility while incurring an acceptable performance degradation. Besides, our security analysis shows that Smartmark is resilient against viable watermarking corruption attacks; e.g., a large number of dummy opcodes are needed to disable a watermark effectively, resulting in producing an illegitimate smart contract clone that is not economical."

Reentrancy, one of the most important vulnerabilities in smart contracts, has caused millions of dollars in financial loss. Many reentrancy detection approaches have been proposed. It is necessary to investigate the performance of these approaches to provide useful guidelines for their application. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on the capability of five well-known or recent reentrancy detection tools such as Mythril and Sailfish. We collect 230,548 verified smart contracts from Etherscan and use detection tools to analyze 139,424 contracts after deduplication, which results in 21,212 contracts with reentrancy issues. Then, we manually examine the defective functions located by the tools in the contracts. From the examination results, we obtain 34 true positive contracts with reentrancy and 21,178 false positive contracts without reentrancy. We also analyze the causes of the true and false positives. Finally, we evaluate the tools based on the two kinds of contracts. The results show that more than 99.8% of the reentrant contracts detected by the tools are false positives with eight types of causes, and the tools can only detect the reentrancy issues caused by call.value(), 58.8% of which can be revealed by the Ethereum's official IDE, Remix. Furthermore, we collect real-world reentrancy attacks reported in the past two years and find that the tools fail to find any issues in the corresponding contracts. Based on the findings, existing works on reentrancy detection appear to have very limited capability, and researchers should turn the rudder to discover and detect new reentrancy patterns except those related to call.value()."

First, we define six typical defects of scripts in Bitcoin history, namely unbinded-txid, simple-key, useless-sig, uncertain-sig, impossible-key, and never-true. Three are inspired by the community, and three are new from us. Second, we develop a tool to discover Bitcoin scripts with any of typical defects based on symbolic execution and enhanced by historical exact scripts. By analyzing all Bitcoin transactions from Oct. 2009 to Aug. 2022, we find that 383,544 transaction outputs are paid to the Bitcoin scripts with defects. The total amount of them is 3,115.43 BTC, which is around 60 million dollars at present. Third, in order to trace the exploitation of the defects, we instrument the Bitcoin VM to record the traces of the real-world spending transactions of the buggy scripts.

To that end, we develop a theoretical model that seeks to understand the link between OSS developer motives and a Sense of Virtual Community (SVC). We test the model with a dataset collected in the Linux Kernel developer community (N=225), using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results for this case study show that intrinsic motivations (social or hedonic motives) are positively associated with a sense of virtual community, but living in an authoritative country and being paid to contribute can reduce the sense of virtual community.

    "abstract": "As one of bad smells in code, code clones may increase the cost of software maintenance and the risk of vulnerability propagation. In the past two decades, numerous clone detection technologies have been proposed. They can be divided into text-based, token-based, tree-based, and graph-based approaches according to their code representations. Different code representations abstract the code details from different perspectives. However, it is unclear which code representation is more effective in detecting code clones and how to combine different code representations to achieve ideal performance. In this paper, we present an empirical study to compare the clone detection ability of different code representations. Specifically, we reproduce 12 clone detection algorithms and divide them into different groups according to their code representations. After analyzing the empirical results, we find that token and tree representations can perform better than graph representation when detecting simple code clones. However, when the code complexity of a code pair increases, graph representation becomes more effective. To make our findings more practical, we perform manual analysis on open-source projects to seek a possible distribution of different clone types in the open-source community. Through the results, we observe that most clone pairs belong to simple code clones. Based on this observation, we discard heavyweight graph-based clone detection algorithms and conduct combination experiments to find out a suitable combination of token-based and tree-based approaches for achieving scalable and effective code clone detection. We develop the suitable combination into a tool called TACC and evaluate it with other state-of-the-art code clone detectors. Experimental results indicate that TACC performs better and has the ability to detect large-scale code clones."

    "abstract": "Detecting code functional similarity forms the basis of various software engineering tasks. However, the detection is challenging as functionally similar code fragments can be implemented differently, e.g., with irrelevant syntax. Recent studies incorporate program dependencies as semantics to identify syntactically different yet semantically similar programs, but they often focus only on local neighborhoods (e.g., one-hop dependencies), limiting the expressiveness of program semantics in modeling functionalities. In this paper, we present Tailor that explicitly exploits deep graph-structured code features for functional similarity detection. Given source-level programs, Tailor first represents them into code property graphs (CPGs) - which combine abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs, and data flow graphs - to collectively reason about program syntax and semantics. Then, Tailor learns representations of CPGs by applying a CPG-based neural network (CPGNN) to iteratively propagate information on them. It improves over prior work on code representation learning through a new graph neural network (GNN) tailored to CPG structures instead of the off-the-shelf GNNs used previously. We systematically evaluate Tailor on C and Java programs using two public benchmarks. Experimental results show that Tailor outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 99.8% and 99.9% F-scores in code clone detection and 98.3% accuracy in source code classification."

    "abstract": "Quantum Computing (QC) is a fast-growing field that has enhanced the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks. Furthermore, the increased availability of computational resources has also contributed to an influx in the development of quantum programs. Given that classical and QC are significantly different due to the intrinsic nature of quantum programs, several aspects of QC (e.g., performance, bugs) have been investigated, and novel approaches have been proposed. However, from a purely quantum perspective, maintenance, one of the major steps in a software development life-cycle, has not been considered by researchers yet. In this paper, we fill this gap and investigate the prevalence of code smells in quantum programs as an indicator of maintenance issues. We defined eight quantum-specific smells and validated them through a survey with 35 quantum developers. Since no tool specifically aims to detect quantum smells, we developed a tool called QSmell that supports the proposed quantum-specific smells. Finally, we conducted an empirical investigation to analyze the prevalence of quantum-specific smells in 15 open-source quantum programs. Our results showed that 11 programs (73.33%) contain at least one smell and, on average, a program has three smells. Furthermore, the long circuit is the most prevalent smell present in 53.33% of the programs."

    "abstract": "Reachable coverage is the number of code elements in the search space of a fuzzer (i.e., an automatic software testing tool). A fuzzer cannot find bugs in code that is unreachable. Hence, reachable coverage quantifies fuzzer effectiveness. Using static program analysis, we can compute an upper bound on the number of reachable coverage elements, e.g., by extracting the call graph. However, we cannot decide whether a coverage element is reachable in general. If we could precisely determine reachable coverage efficiently, we would have solved the software verification problem. Unfortunately, we cannot approach a given degree of accuracy for the static approximation, either. In this paper, we advocate a statistical perspective on the approximation of the number of elements in the fuzzer's search space, where accuracy does improve as a function of the analysis runtime. In applied statistics, corresponding estimators have been developed and well established for more than a quarter century. These estimators hold an exciting promise to finally tackle the long-standing challenge of counting reachability. In this paper, we explore the utility of these estimators in the context of fuzzing. Estimates of reachable coverage can be used to measure (a) the amount of untested code, (b) the effectiveness of the testing technique, and (c) the completeness of the ongoing fuzzing campaign (w.r.t. the asymptotic max. achievable coverage). We make all data and our analysis publicly available."

The performance of mutation-based fuzzers highly depends on the mutation strategy that specifies the probability distribution of selecting mutation methods. As a result, developing an effective mutation strategy has received much attention recently, and program-adaptive techniques, which observe the behavior of the target program to learn the optimized mutation strategy per program, have become a trending approach to achieve better performance. They, however, still have a major limitation; they disregard the impacts of different characteristics of seed inputs which can lead to explore deeper program locations. To address this limitation, we present SEAMFUZZ, a novel fuzzing technique that automatically captures the characteristics of individual seed inputs and applies different mutation strategies for different seed inputs. By capturing the syntactic and semantic similarities between seed inputs, SEAMFUZZ clusters them into proper groups and learns effective mutation strategies tailored for each seed cluster by using the customized Thompson sampling algorithm. Experimental results show that SEAMFUZZ improves both the path-discovering and bug-finding abilities of state-of-the-art fuzzers on real-world programs."

    "abstract": "Java (de)serialization is prone to causing security-critical vulnerabilities that attackers can invoke existing methods (gadgets) on the application's classpath to construct a gadget chain to perform malicious behaviors. Several techniques have been proposed to statically identify suspicious gadget chains and dynamically generate injection objects for fuzzing. However, due to their incomplete support for dynamic program features (e.g., Java runtime polymorphism) and ineffective injection object generation for fuzzing, the existing techniques are still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we first performed an empirical study to investigate the characteristics of Java deserialization vulnerabilities based on our manually collected 86 publicly known gadget chains. The empirical results show that 1) Java deserialization gadgets are usually exploited by abusing runtime polymorphism, which enables attackers to reuse serializable overridden methods; and 2) attackers usually invoke exploitable overridden methods (gadgets) via dynamic binding to generate injection objects for gadget chain construction. Based on our empirical findings, we propose a novel gadget chain mining approach, GCMiner, which captures both explicit and implicit method calls to identify more gadget chains, and adopts an overriding-guided object generation approach to generate valid injection objects for fuzzing. The evaluation results show that GCMiner significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, and discovers 56 unique gadget chains that cannot be identified by the baseline approaches."

    "abstract": "To date, various hybrid fuzzers have been proposed for maximal program vulnerability exposure by integrating the power of fuzzing strategies and concolic executors. While the existing hybrid fuzzers have shown their superiority over conventional coverage-guided fuzzers, they seldom follow equivalent evaluation setups, e.g., benchmarks and seed corpora. Thus, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive study on the existing hybrid fuzzers to provide implications and guidance for future research in this area. To this end, in this paper, we conduct the first extensive study on state-of-the-art hybrid fuzzers. Surprisingly, our study shows that the performance of existing hybrid fuzzers may not well generalize to other experimental settings. Meanwhile, their performance advantages over conventional coverage-guided fuzzers are overall limited. In addition, instead of simply updating the fuzzing strategies or concolic executors, updating their coordination modes potentially poses crucial performance impact of hybrid fuzzers. Accordingly, we propose CoFuzz to improve the effectiveness of hybrid fuzzers by upgrading their coordination modes. Specifically, based on the baseline hybrid fuzzer QSYM, CoFuzz adopts edge-oriented scheduling to schedule edges for applying concolic execution via an online linear regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent. It also adopts sampling-augmenting synchronization to derive seeds for applying fuzzing strategies via the interval path abstraction and John walk as well as incrementally updating the model. Our evaluation results indicate that CoFuzz can significantly increase the edge coverage (e.g., 16.31% higher than the best existing hybrid fuzzer in our study) and expose around 2X more unique crashes than all studied hybrid fuzzers. Moreover, CoFuzz successfully detects 37 previously unknown bugs where 30 are confirmed with 8 new CVEs and 20 are fixed."

We propose a technique called behavioral robustification, which involves systematically and rigorously improving the robustness of a design against potential deviations. Given behavioral models of a system and its environment, along with a set of user-specified deviations, our robustification method produces a redesign that is capable of satisfying a desired property even when the environment exhibits those deviations. In particular, we describe how the robustification problem can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the goal is to restrict the deviating environment from causing a violation of a desired property, while maximizing the amount of existing functionality and minimizing the cost of changes to the original design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies involving the robustness of an electronic voting machine and safety-critical interfaces."

We call these decisions implementation design decisions. Our mixed-methods study includes 46 survey responses and 14 semi-structured interviews with professional developers about their decision types, considerations, processes, and expertise for implementation design decisions. We find that implementation design decisions, rather than being a natural outcome from higher levels of design, require constant monitoring of higher level design choices, such as requirements and architecture. We also show that developers have a consistent general structure to their implementation decision-making process, but no single process is exactly the same. We discuss the implications of our findings on research, education, and practice, including insights on teaching developers how to make implementation design decisions."

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing Federated learning (CFL) is a new crowdsourcing development paradigm for the Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, also called “software 2.0”. In practice, the privacy of CFL can be compromised by many attacks, such as free-rider attacks, adversarial attacks, gradient leakage attacks, and inference attacks. Conventional defensive techniques have low efficiency because they deploy heavy encryption techniques or rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). To improve the efficiency of protecting CFL from these attacks, this paper proposes FedSlice to prevent malicious participants from getting the whole server-side model while keeping the performance goal of CFL. FedSlice breaks the server-side model into several slices and delivers one slice to each participant. Thus, a malicious participant can only get a subset of the server-side model, preventing them from effectively conducting effective attacks. We evaluate FedSlice against these attacks, and results show that FedSlice provides effective defense: the server-side model leakage is reduced from 100% to 43.45%, the success rate of adversarial attacks is reduced from 100% to 11.66%, the average accuracy of membership inference is reduced from 71.91% to 51.58%, and the data leakage from shared gradients is reduced to the level of random guesses. Besides, FedSlice only introduces less than 2% accuracy loss and about 14% computation overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss defense methods against these attacks to the CFL framework."

    "abstract": "Android apps frequently access personal information to provide customized services. Since such information is sensitive in general, regulators require Android app vendors to publish privacy policies that describe what information is collected and why it is collected. Existing work mainly focuses on the types of the collected data but seldom considers the entities that collect user privacy, which could falsely classify problematic declarations about user privacy collected by third-parties into clear disclosures. To address this problem, we propose PTPDroid, a flow-to-policy consistency checking approach and an automated tool, to comprehensively uncover from the privacy policy the violated disclosures to third-parties. Our experiments on real-world apps demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of PTPDroid, and our empirical study on 1,000 popular real-world apps reveals that violated user privacy disclosures to third-parties are prevalent in practice."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172610",
    "abstract": "Today, more than 3 million websites rely on online advertising revenue. Despite the monetary incentives, ads often frustrate users by disrupting their experience, interrupting content, and slowing browsing. To improve ad experiences, leading media associations define Better Ads Standards for ads that are below user expectations. However, little is known about how well websites comply with these standards and whether existing approaches are sufficient for developers to quickly resolve such issues. In this paper, we propose Adhere, a technique that can detect intrusive ads that do not comply with Better Ads Standards and suggest repair proposals. Adhere works by first parsing the initial web page to a DOM tree to search for potential static ads, and then using mutation observers to monitor and detect intrusive (dynamic/static) ads on the fly. To handle ads' volatile nature, Adhere includes two detection algorithms for desktop and mobile ads to identify different ad violations during three phases of page load events. It recursively applies the detection algorithms to resolve nested layers of DOM elements inserted by ad delegations. We evaluate Adhere on Alexa Top 1 Million Websites. The results show that Adhere is effective in detecting violating ads and suggesting repair proposals. Comparing to the current available alternative, Adhere detected intrusive ads on 4,656 more mobile websites and 3,911 more desktop websites, and improved recall by 16.6% and accuracy by 4.2%."

    "abstract": "Open-source, community-driven package repositories see thousands of malware packages each year, but do not currently run automated malware detection systems. In this work, we explore the security goals of the repository administrators and the requirements for deploying such malware scanners via a case study of the Python ecosystem and PyPI repository, including interviews with administrators and maintainers. Further, we evaluate existing malware detection techniques for deployment in this setting by creating a benchmark dataset and comparing several existing tools: the malware checks implemented in PyPI, Bandit4Mal, and OSSGadget's OSS Detect Backdoor. We find that repository administrators have exacting requirements for such malware detection tools. Specifically, they consider a false positive rate of even 0.1% to be unacceptably high, given the large number of package releases that might trigger false alerts. Measured tools have false positive rates between 15% and 97%; increasing thresholds for detection rules to reduce this rate renders the true positive rate useless. While automated tools are far from reaching these demands, we find that a socio-technical malware detection system has emerged to meet these needs: external security researchers perform repository malware scans, filter for useful results, and report the results to repository administrators. These parties face different incentives and constraints on their time and tooling. We conclude with recommendations for improving detection capabilities and strengthening the collaboration between security researchers and software repository administrators."

    "abstract": "In Federated Learning (FL), clients independently train local models and share them with a central aggregator to build a global model. Impermissibility to access clients' data and collaborative training make FL appealing for applications with data-privacy concerns, such as medical imaging. However, these FL characteristics pose unprecedented challenges for debugging. When a global model's performance deteriorates, identifying the responsible rounds and clients is a major pain point. Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with subsets of clients, hoping to increase the global model's accuracy or let future FL rounds retune the model, which are time-consuming and costly. We design a systematic fault localization framework, Fedde-bug,that advances the FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, Feddebug enables interactive debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. Feddebug'sbreakpoint can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model) and move between rounds and clients' models seam-lessly, enabling a fine-grained step-by-step inspection. Second, Feddebug automatically identifies the client(s) responsible for lowering the global model's performance without any testing data and labels-both are essential for existing debugging techniques. Feddebug's strengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neuron activations to determine the client(s) deviating from normal behavior. Feddebug achieves 100% accuracy in finding a single faulty client and 90.3% accuracy in finding multiple faulty clients. Feddebug's interactive de-bugging incurs 1.2% overhead during training, while it localizes a faulty client in only 2.1% of a round's training time. With FedDebug,we bring effective debugging practices to federated learning, improving the quality and productivity of FL application developers."

    "abstract": "Despite their stunning performance, developing deep learning models from scratch is a formidable task. Therefore, it popularizes Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS), where general users can access the trained models of MLaaS providers via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on a pay-per-query basis. Unfortunately, the success of MLaaS is under threat from model extraction attacks, where attackers intend to extract a local model of equivalent functionality to the target MLaaS model. However, existing studies on model extraction of text analytics APIs frequently assume adversaries have strong knowledge about the victim model, like its architecture and parameters, which hardly holds in practice. Besides, since the attacker's and the victim's training data can be considerably discrepant, it is non-trivial to perform efficient model extraction. In this paper, to advance the understanding of such attacks, we propose a framework, PEEP, for practical and efficient model extraction of sentiment analysis APIs with only query access. Specifically, PEEP features a learning-based scheme, which employs out-of-domain public corpora and a novel query strategy to construct proxy training data for model extraction. Besides, PEEP introduces a greedy search algorithm to settle an appropriate architecture for the extracted model. We conducted extensive experiments with two victim models across three datasets and two real-life commercial sentiment analysis APIs. Experimental results corroborate that PEEP can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advances showing that a model pre-trained on large-scale source code data is able to gain appreciable generalization capability, it still requires a sizeable amount of data on the target task for fine-tuning. And the effectiveness of the model generalization is largely affected by the size and quality of the fine-tuning data, which is detrimental for target tasks with limited or unavailable resources. Therefore, cross-task generalization, with the goal of improving the generalization of the model to unseen tasks that have not been seen before, is of strong research and application value. In this paper, we propose a large-scale benchmark that includes 216 existing code-related tasks. Then, we annotate each task with the corresponding meta information such as task description and instruction, which contains detailed information about the task and a solution guide. This also helps us to easily create a wide variety of “training/evaluation” task splits to evaluate the various cross-task generalization capabilities of the model. Then we perform some preliminary experiments to demonstrate that the cross-task generalization of models can be largely improved by in-context learning methods such as few-shot learning and learning from task instructions, which shows the promising prospects of conducting cross-task learning research on our benchmark. We hope that the collection of the datasets and our benchmark will facilitate future work that is not limited to cross-task generalization."

    "abstract": "Testing and debugging the implementation of static analysis is a challenging task, often involving significant manual effort from domain experts in a tedious and unprincipled process. In this work, we propose an approach that greatly improves the automation of this process for static analyzers with configuration options. At the core of our approach is the novel adaptation of the theoretical partial order relations that exist between these options to reason about the correctness of actual results from running the static analyzer with different configurations. This allows for automated testing of static analyzers with clearly defined oracles, followed by automated delta debugging, even in cases where ground truths are not defined over the input programs. To apply this approach to many static analysis tools, we design and implement ECSTATIC, an easy-to-extend, open-source framework. We have integrated four popular static analysis tools, SOOT, WALA, DOOP, and FlowDroid, into ECSTATIC. Our evaluation shows running ECSTATIC detects 74 partial order bugs in the four tools and produces reduced bug-inducing programs to assist debugging. We reported 42 bugs; in all cases where we received responses, the tool developers confirmed the reported tool behavior was unintended. So far, three bugs have been fixed and there are ongoing discussions to fix more."

    "abstract": "Numerous program slicing approaches aim to help developers troubleshoot regression failures - one of the most time-consuming development tasks. The main idea behind these approaches is to identify a subset of interdependent program statements relevant to the failure, minimizing the amount of code developers need to inspect. Accuracy and reduction rate achieved by slicing are the key considerations toward their applicability in practice: inspecting only the statements in a slice should be faster and more efficient than inspecting the code in full. In this paper, we report on our experiment applying one of the most recent and accurate slicing approaches, dual slicing, to the task of troubleshooting regression failures. As subjects, we use projects from the popular Defects4J benchmark and a systematically-collected set of eight large, open-source client-library project pairs with at least one library upgrade failure, which we refer to as LibRench. The results of our experiments show that the produced slices, while effective in reducing the scope of manual inspection, are still very large to be comfortably analyzed by a human. When inspecting these slices, we observe that most statements in a slice deal with the propagation of information between changed code blocks; these statements are essential for obtaining the necessary context for the changes but are not responsible for the failure directly. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel approach, implemented in a tool named INPRESS, for further reducing the size of a slice by accurately identifying and summarizing the propagation-related code blocks. Our evaluation of INPRESS shows that it is able to produce slices that are 76% shorter than the original ones (207 vs. 2,007 execution statements, on average), thus, reducing the amount of information developers need to inspect without losing the necessary contextual information."

    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172837",
    "abstract": "Java's Stream API, that massively makes use of lambda expressions, permits a more declarative way of defining operations on collections in comparison to traditional loops. While experimental results suggest that the use of the Stream API has measurable benefits with respect to code readability (in comparison to loops), a remaining question is whether it has other implications. And one of such implications is, for example, tooling in general and debugging in particular because of the following: While the traditional loop-based approach applies filters one after another to single elements, the Stream API applies filters on whole collections. In the meantime there are dedicated debuggers for the Stream API, but it remains unclear whether such a debugger (on the Stream API) has a measurable benefit in comparison to the traditional stepwise debugger (on loops). The present papers introduces a controlled experiment on the debugging of filter operations using a stepwise debugger versus a stream debugger. The results indicate that under the experiment's settings the stream debugger has a significant ($\\mathrm{p} < .001$) and large, positive effect $(\\eta_{p}^{2}=.899;\\ \\frac{M_{stepwise}}{M_{stream}} \\sim 204\\%)$. However, the experiment reveals that additional factors interact with the debugger treatment such as whether or not the failing object is known upfront. The mentioned factor has a strong and large disordinal interaction effect with the debugger ($\\mathrm{p} < .001; \\eta_{p}^{2}=.928$): In case an object is known upfront that can be used to identify a failing filter, the stream debugger is even less efficient than the stepwise debugger $(\\frac{M_{stepwise}}{M_{stream}}\\sim 72\\%)$. Hence, while we found overall a positive effect of the stream debugger, the answer whether or not debugging is easier on loops or streams cannot be answered without taking the other variables into account. Consequently, we see a contribution of the present paper not only in the comparison of different debuggers but in the identification of additional factors."

    "abstract": "A Bug Inducing Commit (BIC) is a commit that introduces a software bug into the codebase. Knowing the relevant BIC for a given bug can provide valuable information for debugging as well as bug triaging. However, existing BIC identification techniques are either too expensive (because they require the failing tests to be executed against previous versions for bisection) or inapplicable at the debugging time (because they require post hoc artefacts such as bug reports or bug fixes). We propose Fonte, an efficient and accurate BIC identification technique that only requires test coverage. Fonte combines Fault Localisation (FL) with BIC identification and ranks commits based on the suspiciousness of the code elements that they modified. Fonte reduces the search space of BICs using failure coverage as well as a filter that detects commits that are merely style changes. Our empirical evaluation using 130 real-world BICs shows that Fonte significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIC identification techniques based on Information Retrieval as well as neural code embedding models, achieving at least 39% higher MRR. We also report that the ranking scores produced by Fonte can be used to perform weighted bisection, further reducing the cost of BIC identification. Finally, we apply Fonte to a large-scale industry project with over 10M lines of code, and show that it can rank the actual BIC within the top five commits for 87% of the studied real batch-testing failures, and save the BIC inspection cost by 32% on average."

To resolve the above challenges, we propose RepresentThemAll, a pre-trained approach that can learn the universal representation of bug reports and handle multiple downstream tasks. Specifically, RepresentThemAll is a universal bug report framework that is pre-trained with two carefully designed learning objectives: one is the dynamic masked language model and another one is a contrastive learning objective, “find yourself”. We evaluate the performance of RepresentThemAll on four downstream tasks, including duplicate bug report detection, bug report summarization, bug priority prediction, and bug severity prediction. Our experimental results show that RepresentThemAll outperforms all baseline approaches on all considered downstream tasks after well-designed fine-tuning."

In this paper, we conducted the first in-depth study on 75 real-world OCBugs from 5 widely used systems to understand the symptoms, root causes, and triggering conditions of OCBugs. Based on our study, we designed and implemented Parachute, an automated testing framework to detect OCBugs. Our key insight is that the value of one configuration option, either loaded at the startup phase or updated on the fly, should have the same effects on the target program. Parachute generates tests for on-the-fly configuration updates by mutating the existing tests and conducts differential analysis to identify OCBugs. We evaluated Parachute on 7 real-world software systems. The results show that Parachute detected 75% (42/56) of the known OCBugs, and reported 13 unknown bugs, 11 of which have been confirmed or fixed by developers until the time of writing."

Our evaluation using three performance metrics shows that Bugsplainer can generate understandable and good explanations according to Google's standard, and can outperform multiple baselines from the literature.

To attract newcomers and facilitate their onboarding, many OSS projects recommend tasks for newcomers, such as good first issues (GFIs). Previous studies have preliminarily investigated the effects of GFIs and techniques to identify suitable GFIs. However, it is still unclear whether just recommending tasks is enough and how significant mentoring is for newcomers. To better understand mentoring in OSS communities, we analyze the resolution process of 48,402 GFIs from 964 repositories through a mix-method approach. We investigate the extent, the mentorship structures, the discussed topics, and the relevance of expert involvement. We find that ~70% of GFIs have expert participation, with each GFI usually having one expert who makes two comments. Half of GFIs will receive their first expert comment within 8.5 hours after a newcomer comment. Through analysis of the collaboration networks of newcomers and experts, we observe that community mentorship presents four types of structure: centralized mentoring, decentralized mentoring, collaborative mentoring, and distributed mentoring. As for discussed topics, we identify 14 newcomer challenges and 18 expert mentoring content. By fitting the generalized linear models, we find that expert involvement positively correlates with newcomers' successful contributions but negatively correlates with newcomers' retention. Our study manifests the status and significance of mentoring in the OSS projects, which provides rich practical implications for optimizing the mentoring process and helping newcomers contribute smoothly and suecessfully,"

Building sustainable OSS projects from a nascent state requires effective project governance and socio-technical structure to be interleaved, in a complex and dynamic process. Although individual disciplines have studied each separately, little is known about how governance and software development work together in practice toward sustainability. Prior work has shown that many OSS projects experience large, episodic changes over short periods of time, which can propel them or drag them down. However, sustainable projects typically manage to come out unscathed from such changes, while others do not. The natural questions arise: Can we identify the back-and-forth between governance and socio-technical structure that lead to sustainability following episodic events? And, how about those that do not lead to sustainability? From a data set of social, technical, and policy digital traces from 262 sustainability-labeled ASF incubator projects, here we employ a large-scale empirical study to characterize episodic changes in socio-technical aspects measured by Change Intervals (CI), governance rules and regulations in a form of Institutional Statements (IS), and the temporal relationships between them. We find that sustainable projects during episodic changes can adapt themselves to institutional statements more efficiently, and that institutional discussions can lead to episodic changes intervals in socio-technical aspects of the projects, and vice versa. In practice, these results can provide timely guidance beyond socio-technical considerations, adding rules and regulations in the mix, toward a unified analytical framework for OSS project sustainability."

    "abstract": "Pressure for higher productivity and faster delivery is increasingly pervading software organizations. This can lead software engineers to act like chess players playing a gambit—making sacrifices of their technically sound estimates, thus submitting their teams to time pressure. In turn, time pressure can have varied detrimental effects, such as poor product quality and emotional distress, decreasing productivity, which leads to more time pressure and delays: a hard-to-stop vicious cycle. This reveals a need for moving on from the more passive strategy of yielding to pressure to a more active one of defending software estimates. Therefore, we propose an approach to support software estimators in acquiring knowledge on how to carry out such defense, by introducing negotiation principles encapsulated in a set of defense lenses, presented through a digital simulation. We evaluated the proposed approach through a controlled experiment with software practitioners from different companies. We collected data on participants' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions to perform the defense of their estimates in light of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We employed a frequentist and a bayesian approach to data analysis. Results show improved scores among experimental group participants after engaging with the digital simulation and learning about the lenses. They were also more inclined to choose a defense action when facing pressure scenarios than a control group exposed to questions to reflect on the reasons and outcomes of pressure over estimates. Qualitative evidence reveals that practitioners perceived the set of lenses as useful in their current work environments. Collectively, these results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its perceived relevance for the industry, despite the low amount of time required to engage with it."

    "abstract": "Concurrent programs suffer from data races. To prevent data races, programmers use locks. However, programs can eliminate data races only when they acquire and release correct locks at correct timing. The lock API of C, in which people have developed a large portion of legacy system programs, does not validate the correct use of locks. On the other hand, Rust, a recently developed system programming language, provides a lock API that guarantees the correct use of locks via type checking. This makes rewriting legacy system programs in Rust a promising way to retrofit safety into them. Unfortunately, manual C-to-Rust translation is extremely laborious due to the discrepancies between their lock APIs. Even the state-of-the-art automatic C-to-Rust translator retains the C lock API, expecting developers to replace them with the Rust lock API. In this work, we propose an automatic tool to replace the C lock API with the Rust lock API. It facilitates C-to-Rust translation of concurrent programs with less human effort than the current practice. Our tool consists of a Rust code transformer that takes a lock summary as an input and a static analyzer that efficiently generates precise lock summaries. We show that the transformer is scalable and widely applicable while preserving the semantics; it transforms 66 KLOC in 2.6 seconds and successfully handles 74% of real-world programs. We also show that the analyzer is scalable and precise; it analyzes 66 KLOC in 4.3 seconds."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172724",
    "abstract": "Reactive synthesis is an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system from its temporal logic specification. Two of the main challenges in bringing reactive synthesis to practice are its very high worst-case complexity and the difficulty of writing declarative specifications using basic LTL operators. To address the first challenge, researchers have suggested the GR(1) fragment of LTL, which has an efficient poly-nomial time symbolic synthesis algorithm. To address the second challenge, specification languages include higher-level constructs that aim at allowing engineers to write succinct and readable specifications. One such construct is the triggers operator, as supported, e.g., in the Property Specification Language (PSL). In this work we introduce triggers into specifications for reactive synthesis. The effectiveness of our contribution relies on a novel encoding of regular expressions using symbolic finite automata (SFA) and on a novel semantics for triggers that, in contrast to PSL triggers, admits an efficient translation into GR(1). We show that our triggers are expressive and succinct, and prove that our encoding is optimal. We have implemented our ideas on top of the Spectra language and synthesizer. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of using triggers in specifications for synthesis, as well as the challenges involved in using them, via a study of more than 300 triggers written by undergraduate students who participated in a project class on writing specifications for synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce triggers into specifications for reactive synthesis."

    "abstract": "Reactive synthesis is an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system from its temporal logic specification. Despite its attractiveness and major research progress in the past decades, reactive synthesis is still in early-stage and has not gained popularity outside academia. We conducted an exploratory case study in which we followed students in a semester-long university workshop class on their end-to-end use of a reactive synthesizer, from writing the specifications to executing the synthesized controllers. The data we collected includes more than 500 versions of more than 80 specifications, as well as more than 2500 Slack messages, all written by the class participants. Our grounded theory analysis reveals that the use of reactive synthesis has clear benefits for certain tasks and that adequate specification language constructs assist in the specification writing process. However, inherent issues such as unrealizabilty, non-well-separation, the gap of knowledge between the users and the synthesizer, and considerable running times prevent reactive synthesis from fulfilling its promise. Based on our analysis, we propose action items in the directions of language and specification quality, tools for analysis and execution, and process and methodology, all towards making reactive synthesis more applicable for software engineers."

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in software migration as the development of software and society. Manually migrating projects between languages is error-prone and expensive. In recent years, researchers have begun to explore automatic program translation using supervised deep learning techniques by learning from large-scale parallel code corpus. However, parallel resources are scarce in the programming language domain, and it is costly to collect bilingual data manually. To address this issue, several unsupervised programming translation systems are proposed. However, these systems still rely on huge monolingual source code to train, which is very expensive. Besides, these models cannot perform well for translating the languages that are not seen during the pre-training procedure. In this paper, we propose SDA-Trans, a syntax and domain-aware model for program translation, which leverages the syntax structure and domain knowledge to enhance the cross-lingual transfer ability. SDA-Trans adopts unsupervised training on a smaller-scale corpus, including Python and Java monolingual programs. The experimental results on function translation tasks between Python, Java, and C++ show that SDA-Trans outperforms many large-scale pre-trained models, especially for unseen language translation."

However, in real-world practice, comments are complicated, which often contain information reflecting various intentions of developers, e.g., functionality summarization, design rationale, implementation details, code properties, etc. To bridge the gap between automatic code comment generation and real-world comment practice, we define Developer-Intent Driven Code Comment Generation, which can generate intent-aware comments for the same source code with different intents. To tackle this challenging task, we propose DOME, an approach that utilizes Intent-guided Selective Attention to explicitly select intent-relevant information from the source code, and produces various comments reflecting different intents. Our approach is evaluated on two real-world Java datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. A human evaluation also confirms the significant potential of applying DOME in practical usage, enabling developers to comment code effectively according to their own needs."

However, as a data-driven paradigm, how would the data quality impact the effectiveness of these methods remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore this problem under the context of just-in-time obsolete comment detection. Specifically, we first conduct data cleaning on the existing benchmark dataset, and empirically observe that with only 0.22% label corrections and even 15.0% fewer data, the existing obsolete comment detection approaches can achieve up to 10.7% relative accuracy improvement. To further mitigate the data quality issues, we propose an adversarial learning framework to simultaneously estimate the data quality and make the final predictions. Experimental evaluations show that this adversarial learning framework can further improve the relative accuracy by up to 18.1% compared to the state-of-the-art method. Although our current results are from the obsolete comment detection problem, we believe that the proposed two-phase solution, which handles the data quality issues through both the data aspect and the algorithm aspect, is also generalizable and applicable to other machine learning based software engineering tasks."

    "abstract": "Commit messages summarize code changes and help developers understand the intention. To alleviate human efforts in writing commit messages, researchers have proposed various automated commit message generation techniques, among which learning-based techniques have achieved great success in recent years. However, existing evaluation on learning-based commit message generation relies on the automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU) widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which are aggregated scores calculated based on the similarity between generated commit messages and the ground truth. Therefore, it remains unclear what generated commit messages look like and what kind of commit messages could be precisely generated by existing learning-based techniques. To fill this knowledge gap, this work performs the first study to systematically investigate the detailed commit messages generated by learning-based techniques. In particular, we first investigate the frequent patterns of the commit messages generated by state-of-the-art learning-based techniques. Surprisingly, we find the majority (~90%) of their generated commit messages belong to simple patterns (i.e., addition/removal/fix/avoidance patterns). To further explore the reasons, we then study the impact of datasets, input representations, and model components. We surprisingly find that existing learning-based techniques have competitive performance even when the inputs are only represented by change marks (i.e., “+”/“-”/“ ”), It indicates that existing learning-based techniques poorly utilize syntax and semantics in the code while mostly focusing on change marks, which could be the major reason for generating so many pattern-matching commit messages. We also find that the pattern ratio in the training set might also positively affect the pattern ratio of generated commit messages; and model components might have different impact on the pattern ratio."

The presence of the issue report/pull request links referenced in a commit message has been treated as a way of providing Why information. In this study, we found several quality issues that could hamper the links' ability to provide Why information. Based on this observation, we developed a machine learning classifier for automatically identifying whether a commit message has What and Why information by considering both the commit messages and the link contents. This classifier outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers by 12 percentage points improvement in the F1 score. With the improved classifier, we conducted a mixed method empirical analysis and found that: (1) Commit message quality has an impact on software defect proneness, and (2) the overall quality of the commit messages decreases over time, while developers believe they are writing better commit messages.

    "abstract": "The significance of logs has been widely acknowledged with the adoption of various log analysis techniques that assist in software engineering tasks. Many log analysis techniques require structured logs as input while raw logs are typically unstructured. Automated log parsing is proposed to convert unstructured raw logs into structured log templates. Some log parsers achieve promising accuracy, yet they rely on significant efforts from the users to tune the parameters to achieve optimal results. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study to understand the influence of the configurable parameters of six state-of-the-art log parsers on their parsing results on three aspects: 1) varying the parameters while using the same dataset, 2) keeping the same parameters while using different datasets, and 3) using different samples from the same dataset. Our results show that all these parsers are sensitive to the parameters, posing challenges to their adoption in practice. To mitigate such challenges, we propose PILAR (Parameter Insensitive Log Parser), an entropy-based log parsing approach. We compare PILAR with the existing log parsers on the same three aspects and find that PILAR is the most parameter-insensitive one. In addition, PILAR achieves the second highest parsing accuracy and efficiency among all the state-of-the-art log parsers.

    "abstract": "Due to the sheer size of software logs, developers rely on automated techniques for log analysis. One of the first and most important steps of automated log analysis is log abstraction, which parses the raw logs into a structured format. Prior log abstraction techniques aim to identify and abstract all the dynamic variables in logs and output a static log template for automated log analysis. However, these abstracted dynamic variables may also contain important information that is useful to different tasks in log analysis. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of dynamic variables and their importance in practice, and explore the potential of a variable-aware log abstraction technique. Through manual investigations and surveys with practitioners, we find that different categories of dynamic variables record various information that can be important depending on the given tasks, the distinction of dynamic variables in log abstraction can further assist in log analysis. We then propose a deep learning based log abstraction approach, named VALB, which can identify different categories of dynamic variables and preserve the value of specified categories of dynamic variables along with the log templates (i.e., variable-aware log abstraction). Through the evaluation on a widely used log abstraction benchmark, we find that VALB outperforms other state-of-the-art log abstraction techniques on general log abstraction (i.e., when abstracting all the dynamic variables) and also achieves a high variable-aware log abstraction accuracy that further identifies the category of the dynamic variables. Our study highlights the potential of leveraging the important information recorded in the dynamic variables to further improve the process of log analysis."

    "abstract": "Prior work shows that misleading logging texts (i.e., the textual descriptions in logging statements) can be counterproductive for developers during their use of logs. One of the most important types of information provided by logs is the temporal information of the recorded system behavior. For example, a logging text may use a perfective aspect to describe a fact that an important system event has finished. Although prior work has performed extensive studies on automated logging suggestions, few of these studies investigate the temporal relations between logging and code. In this work, we make the first attempt to comprehensively study the temporal relations between logging and its corresponding source code. In particular, we focus on two types of temporal relations: (1) logical temporal relations, which can be inferred from the execution order between the logging statement and the corresponding source code; and (2) semantic temporal relations, which can be inferred based on the semantic meaning of the logging text. We first perform qualitative analyses to study these two types of logging-code temporal relations and the inconsistency between them. As a result, we derive rules to detect these two types of temporal relations and their inconsistencies. Based on these rules, we propose a tool named TempoLo to automatically detect the issues of temporal inconsistencies between logging and code. Through an evaluation of four projects, we find that TempoLo can effectively detect temporal inconsistencies with a small number of false positives. To gather developers' feedback on whether such inconsistencies are worth fixing, we report 15 detected instances from these projects to developers. 13 instances from three projects are confirmed and fixed, while two instances of the remaining project are pending at the time of this writing. Our work lays the foundation for describing temporal relations between logging and code and demonstrates the potential for a deeper understanding of the relationship between logging and code."

Software developers generally carry out logging practices with clear intentions and associated concerns (I&Cs). However, I&Cs may not be properly fulfilled in source code as log placement - specifically determination of a log statement's context and content - is often susceptible to an individual's profile and experience. Some industrial studies have been conducted to discern developers' main logging I&Cs and the way I&Cs are fulfilled. However, the findings are only based on the developers from a single company in each individual study and hence have limited generalizability. More importantly, there lacks a comprehensive and deep understanding of the relationships between developers' profiles and experiences and their logging practices from a wider perspective. To fill this significant gap, we conducted an empirical study using mixed methods comprising questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and code analyses with practitioners from a wide range of companies across a variety of industrial domains. Results reveal that while developers share common logging I&Cs and conduct logging practices mainly in the coding stage, their profiles and experiences profoundly influence their logging I&Cs and the way the I&Cs are fulfilled. These findings pave the way to facilitate the acceptance of important logging I&Cs and the adoption of good logging practices by developers"

    "abstract": "Programs often emit natural language messages, e.g., in logging statements or exceptions raised on unexpected paths. To be meaningful to users and developers, the message, i.e., what to say, must be consistent with the condition under which it gets triggered, i.e., when to say it. However, checking for inconsistencies between conditions and messages is challenging because the conditions are expressed in the logic of the programming language, while messages are informally expressed in natural language. This paper presents CMI-Finder, an approach for detecting condition-message inconsistencies. CMI-Finder is based on a neural model that takes a condition and a message as its input and then predicts whether the two are consistent. To address the problem of obtaining realistic, diverse, and large-scale training data, we present six techniques to generate large numbers of inconsistent examples to learn from automatically. Moreover, we describe and compare three neural models, which are based on binary classification, triplet loss, and fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation applies the approach to 300K condition-message statements extracted from 42 million lines of Python code. The best model achieves a precision of 78% at a recall of 72% on a dataset of past bug fixes. Applying the approach to the newest versions of popular open-source projects reveals 50 previously unknown bugs, 19 of which have been confirmed by the developers so far."

    "abstract": "Logs, being run-time information automatically generated by software, record system events and activities with their timestamps. Before obtaining more insights into the run-time status of the software, a fundamental step of log analysis, called log parsing, is employed to extract structured templates and parameters from the semi-structured raw log messages. However, current log parsers are all syntax-based and regard each message as a character string, ignoring the semantic information included in parameters and templates. Thus, we propose the first semantic-based parser SemParser to unlock the critical bottleneck of mining semantics from log messages. It contains two steps, an end-to-end semantics miner and a joint parser. Specifically, the first step aims to identify explicit semantics inside a single log, and the second step is responsible for jointly inferring implicit semantics and computing structural outputs according to the contextual knowledge base of the logs. To analyze the effectiveness of our semantic parser, we first demonstrate that it can derive rich semantics from log messages collected from six widely-applied systems with an average F1 score of 0.985. Then, we conduct two representative downstream tasks, showing that current downstream models improve their performance with appropriately extracted semantics by 1.2%-11.7% and 8.65% on two anomaly detection datasets and a failure identification dataset, respectively. We believe these findings provide insights into semantically understanding log messages for the log analysis community."

To achieve high test effectiveness, automated UI testing prioritizes a UI event based on its exploration value (e.g., the increased code coverage of future exploration rooted from the UI event). Various strategies have been proposed to estimate the exploration value of a UI event without considering its exploration diversity (reflecting the variance of covered code entities achieved by explorations rooted from this UI event across its different triggerings), resulting in low test effectiveness, especially on complex mobile apps. To address the preceding problem, in this paper, we propose a new approach named Badge to prioritize UI events considering both their exploration values and exploration diversity for effective automated UI testing. In particular, we design a hierarchical multi-armed bandit model to effectively estimate the exploration value and exploration diversity of a UI event based on its historical explorations along with historical explorations rooted from UI events in the same UI group. We evaluate Badge on 21 highly popular industrial apps widely used by previous related work. Experimental results show that Badge outperforms state-of-the-art/practice tools with 18%-146% relative code coverage improvement and finding 1.19-5.20 × unique crashes, demonstrating the effectiveness of Badge.

    "abstract": "Due to the importance of Android app quality assurance, many automated GUI testing tools have been developed. Although the test algorithms have been improved, the impact of GUI rendering has been overlooked. On the one hand, setting a long waiting time to execute events on fully rendered GUIs slows down the testing process. On the other hand, setting a short waiting time will cause the events to execute on partially rendered GUIs, which negatively affects the testing effectiveness. An optimal waiting time should strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency. We propose AdaT, a lightweight image-based approach to dynamically adjust the inter-event time based on GUI rendering state. Given the real-time streaming on the GUI, AdaT presents a deep learning model to infer the rendering state, and synchronizes with the testing tool to schedule the next event when the GUI is fully rendered. The evaluations demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of our approach. We also integrate our approach with the existing automated testing tool to demonstrate the usefulness of AdaT in covering more activities and executing more events on fully rendered GUIs."

To address this concern, it is crucial to track the flow of sensitive data in mini-programs for either human analysis or automated tools.

    "abstract": "As most smart contracts have a financial nature and handle valuable assets, smart contract developers use access control to protect assets managed by smart contracts from being misused by malicious or unauthorized people. Unfortunately, programming languages used for writing smart contracts, such as Solidity, were not designed with a permission-based security model in mind. Therefore, smart contract developers implement access control checks based on their judgment and in an adhoc manner, which results in several vulnerabilities in smart contracts, called access control vulnerabilities. Further, the in-consistency in implementing access control makes it difficult to reason about whether a contract meets access control needs and is free of access control vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose AChecker - an approach for detecting access control vulnerabilities. Unlike prior work, AChecker does not rely on pre-defined patterns or contract transactions history. Instead, it infers access control implemented in smart contracts via static data-flow analysis. Moreover, the approach performs further symbolic-based analysis to distinguish cases when unauthorized people can obtain control of the contract as intended functionality. We evaluated AChecker on three public datasets of real-world smart contracts, including one which consists of contracts with assigned access control CVEs, and compared its effectiveness with eight analysis tools. The evaluation results showed that AChecker outperforms these tools in terms of both precision and recall.

However, the existing detection methods can only identify the presence of a patch (i.e., a binary classification) but fail to pinpoint the vulnerability type. In this work, we take the first step to categorize the security patches into fine-grained vulnerability types. Specifically, we use the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as the label and perform fine-grained classification using categories at the third level of the CWE tree. We first formulate the task as a Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC) problem, i.e., inferring a path (a sequence of CWE nodes) from the root of the CWE tree to the node at the target depth. We then propose an approach named TreeVul with a hierarchical and chained architecture, which manages to utilize the structure information of the CWE tree as prior knowledge of the classification task. We further propose a tree structure aware and beam search based inference algorithm for retrieving the optimal path with the highest merged probability. We collect a large security patch dataset from NVD, consisting of 6,541 commits from 1,560 GitHub OSS repositories. Experimental results show that Tree-vulsignificantly outperforms the best performing baselines, with improvements of 5.9%, 25.0%, and 7.7% in terms of weighted F1-score, macro F1-score, and MCC, respectively.

For beneficial reasons, open-source maintainers often fix the vulnerabilities silently, exposing their users unaware of the updates to threats. Previous works all focus on black-box binary detection of the silent dependency alerts that suffer from high false-positive rates. Open-source software users need to analyze and explain AI prediction themselves. Explainable AI becomes remarkable as a complementary of black-box AI models, providing details in various forms to explain AI decisions. Noticing there is still no technique that can discover silent dependency alert on time, in this work, we propose a framework using an encoder-decoder model with a binary detector to provide explainable silent dependency alert prediction. Our model generates 4 types of vulnerability key aspects including vulnerability type, root cause, attack vector, and impact to enhance the trustworthiness and users' acceptance to alert prediction. By experiments with several models and inputs, we confirm CodeBERT with both commit messages and code changes achieves the best results. Our user study shows that explainable alert predictions can help users find silent dependency alert more easily than black-box predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on the application of Explainable AI in silent dependency alert prediction, which opens the door of the related domains."

    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172769",
    "abstract": "Training deep neural network (DNN) models, which has become an important task in today's software development, is often costly in terms of computational resources and time. With the inspiration of software reuse, building DNN models through reusing existing ones has gained increasing attention recently. Prior approaches to DNN model reuse have two main limitations: 1) reusing the entire model, while only a small part of the model's functionalities (labels) are required, would cause much overhead (e.g., computational and time costs for inference), and 2) model reuse would inherit the defects and weaknesses of the reused model, and hence put the new system under threats of security attack. To solve the above problem, we propose SeaM, a tool that re-engineers a trained DNN model to improve its reusability. Specifically, given a target problem and a trained model, SeaM utilizes a gradient-based search method to search for the model's weights that are relevant to the target problem. The re-engineered model that only retains the relevant weights is then reused to solve the target problem. Evaluation results on widely-used models show that the re-engineered models produced by SeaM only contain 10.11% weights of the original models, resulting 42.41% reduction in terms of inference time. For the target problem, the re-engineered models even outperform the original models in classification accuracy by 5.85%. Moreover, reusing the re-engineered models inherits an average of 57% fewer defects than reusing the entire model. We believe our approach to reducing reuse overhead and defect inheritance is one important step forward for practical model reuse."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172702",
    "abstract": "Because of the naturalness of software and the rapid evolution of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, frequently repeated code change patterns (CPATs) occur often. They range from simple API migrations to changes involving several complex control structures such as for loops. While manually performing CPATs is tedious, the current state-of-the-art techniques for inferring transformation rules are not advanced enough to handle unseen variants of complex CPATs, resulting in a low recall rate. In this paper we present a novel, automated workflow that mines CPATs, infers the transformation rules, and then transplants them automatically to new target sites. We designed, implemented, evaluated and released this in a tool, PYEVOLVE. At its core is a novel data-flow, control-flow aware transformation rule inference engine. Our technique allows us to advance the state-of-the-art for transformation-by-example tools; without it, 70% of the code changes that PYEVOLVE transforms would not be possible to automate. Our thorough empirical evaluation of over 40,000 transformations shows 97% precision and 94% recall. By accepting 90% of CPATs generated by PYEVOLVE in famous open-source projects, developers confirmed its changes are useful."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172675",
    "abstract": "Neural networks are an emerging data-driven programming paradigm widely used in many areas. Unlike traditional software systems consisting of decomposable modules, a neural network is usually delivered as a monolithic package, raising challenges for some maintenance tasks such as model restructure and re-adaption. In this work, we propose DeepArc, a novel modularization method for neural networks, to reduce the cost of model maintenance tasks. Specifically, DeepArc decomposes a neural network into several consecutive modules, each of which encapsulates consecutive layers with similar semantics. The network modularization facilitates practical tasks such as refactoring the model to preserve existing features (e.g., model compression) and enhancing the model with new features (e.g., fitting new samples). The modularization and encapsulation allow us to restructure or retrain the model by only pruning and tuning a few localized neurons and layers. Our experiments show that (1) DeepArc can boost the runtime efficiency of the state-of-the-art model compression techniques by 14.8%; (2) compared to the traditional model retraining, DeepArc only needs to train less than 20% of the neurons on average to fit adversarial samples and repair under-performing models, leading to 32.85% faster training performance while achieving similar model prediction performance."

    "abstract": "Can we take a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to translate between languages and augment it to support a new natural language without retraining the model from scratch? Can we fix the faulty behavior of the RNN by replacing portions associated with the faulty behavior? Recent works on decomposing a fully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) into modules have shown the value of engineering deep models in this manner, which is standard in traditional SE but foreign for deep learning models. However, prior works focus on the image-based multi-class classification problems and cannot be applied to RNN due to (a) different layer structures, (b) loop structures, (c) different types of input-output architectures, and (d) usage of both non-linear and logistic activation functions. In this work, we propose the first approach to decompose an RNN into modules. We study different types of RNNs, i.e., Vanilla, LSTM, and GRU. Further, we show how such RNN modules can be reused and replaced in various scenarios. We evaluate our approach against 5 canonical datasets (i.e., Math QA, Brown Corpus, Wiki-toxicity, Cline OOS, and Tatoeba) and 4 model variants for each dataset. We found that decomposing a trained model has a small cost (Accuracy: -0.6%, BLEU score: +0.10%). Also, the decomposed modules can be reused and replaced without needing to retrain."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172641",
    "abstract": "Tools that alert developers about library vulnerabilities depend on accurate, up-to-date vulnerability databases which are maintained by security researchers. These databases record the libraries related to each vulnerability. However, the vulnerability reports may not explicitly list every library and human analysis is required to determine all the relevant libraries. Human analysis may be slow and expensive, which motivates the need for automated approaches. Researchers and practitioners have proposed to automatically identify libraries from vulnerability reports using extreme multi-label learning (XML). While state-of-the-art XML techniques showed promising performance, their experimental settings do not practically fit what happens in reality. Previous studies randomly split the vulnerability reports data for training and testing their models without considering the chronological order of the reports. This may unduly train the models on chronologically newer reports while testing the models on chronologically older ones. However, in practice, one often receives chronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen libraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of current XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to 0.24 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of vulnerability reports. We propose a practical library identification approach, namely Chronos, based on zero-shot learning. The novelty of Chronos is three-fold. First, Chronos fits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of vulnerability reports. Second, Chronos enriches the data of the vulnerability descriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step. Third, Chronos exploits the temporal ordering of the vulnerability reports using a cache to prioritize prediction of versions of libraries that recently had reports of vulnerabilities. In our experiments, Chronos achieves an average F1-score of 0.75, 3x better than the best XML-based approach. Data enhancement and the time-aware adjustment improve Chronos over the vanilla zero-shot learning model by 27% in average F1."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172868",
    "abstract": "Modern software systems are increasingly relying on dependencies from the ecosystem. A recent estimation shows that around 35% of an open-source project's code come from its depended libraries. Unfortunately, open-source libraries are often threatened by various vulnerability issues, and the number of disclosed vulnerabilities is increasing steadily over the years. Such vulnerabilities can pose significant security threats to the whole ecosystem, not only to the vulnerable libraries themselves, but also to the corresponding downstream projects. Many Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools have been proposed, aiming to detect vulnerable libraries or components referring to existing vulnerability databases. However, recent studies report that such tools often generate a large number of false alerts. Particularly, up to 73.3% of the projects depending on vulnerable libraries are actually safe. Aiming to devise more precise tools, understanding the threats of vulnerabilities holistically in the ecosystem is significant, as already performed by a number of existing studies. However, previous researches either analyze at a very coarse granularity (e.g., without analyzing the source code) or are limited by the study scales. This study aims to bridge such gaps. In particular, we collect 44,450 instances of (CVE, upstream, downstream) relations and analyze around 50 million invocations made from downstream to upstream projects to understand the potential threats of upstream vulnerabilities to downstream projects in the Maven ecosystem. Our investigation makes interesting yet significant findings with respect to multiple aspects, including the reach-ability of vulnerabilities, the complexities of the reachable paths as well as how downstream projects and developers perceive upstream vulnerabilities. We believe such findings can not only provide a holistic understanding towards the threats of upstream vulnerabilities in the Maven ecosystem, but also can guide future researches in this field."

    "abstract": "NPM is the largest software ecosystem in the world, offering millions of free, reusable packages. In recent years, various security threats to packages published on npm have been reported, including vulnerabilities that affect millions of users. To continuously improve techniques for detecting vulnerabilities and mitigating attacks that exploit them, a reusable benchmark of vulnerabilities would be highly desirable. Ideally, such a benchmark should be realistic, come with executable exploits, and include fixes of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, there currently is no such benchmark, forcing researchers to repeatedly develop their own evaluation datasets and making it difficult to compare techniques with each other. This paper presents SecBench.js,, the first comprehensive benchmark suite of vulnerabilities and executable exploits for npm. The benchmark comprises 600 vulnerabilities, which cover the five most common vulnerability classes for server-side JavaScript. Each vulnerability comes with a payload that exploits the vulnerability and an oracle that validates successful exploitation. SecBench.js, enables various applications, of which we explore three in this paper: (i) cross-checking SecBench.js, against public security advisories reveals 168 vulnerable versions in 19 packages that are mislabeled in the advisories; (ii) applying simple code transformations to the exploits in our suite helps identify flawed fixes of vulnerabilities; (iii) dynamically analyzing calls to common sink APIs, e.g., exec(), yields a ground truth of code locations for evaluating vulnerability detectors. Beyond providing a reusable benchmark to the community, our work identified 20 zero-day vulnerabilities, most of which are already acknowledged by practitioners."

However, our study on all 922 weaknesses in the CWE and 156,537 vulnerabilities registered in the CVE to date has found a very small coverage of privacy-related vulnerabilities in both systems, only 4.45% in CWE and 0.1% in CVE. These also cover only a small number of areas of privacy threats that have been raised in existing privacy software engineering research, privacy regulations and frameworks, and relevant reputable organisations.

    "abstract": "Exception handling is a mechanism in modern programming languages. Studies have shown that the exception handling code is error-prone. However, there is still limited research on detecting exception handling bugs, especially for C++ programs. To tackle the issue, we try to precisely represent the exception control flow in C++ programs and propose an analysis method that makes use of the control flow to detect such bugs. More specifically, we first extend control flow graph by introducing the concepts of five different kinds of basic blocks, and then modify the classic symbolic execution framework by extending the program state to a quadruple and properly processing try, throw and catch statements. Based on the above techniques, we develop a static analysis tool on the top of Clang Static Analyzer to detect exception handling bugs. We run our tool on projects with high stars from GitHub and find 36 exception handling bugs in 8 projects, with a precision of 84%. We compare our tool with four state-of-the-art static analysis tools (Cppcheck, Clang Static Analyzer, Facebook Infer and IKOS) on projects from GitHub and handmade benchmarks. On the GitHub projects, other tools are not able to detect any exception handling bugs found by our tool. On the handmade benchmarks, our tool has a significant higher recall."

    "abstract": "We present a new learning-based approach for accel-erating disjunctive static bug-finders. Industrial static bug-finders usually perform disjunctive analysis, differentiating program states along different execution paths of a program. Such path-sensitivity is essential for reducing false positives but it also increases analysis costs exponentially. Therefore, practical bug-finders use a state-selection heuristic to keep track of a small number of beneficial states only. However, designing a good heuristic for real-world programs is challenging; as a result, modern static bug-finders still suffer from low cost/bug-finding efficiency. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by learning effective state-selection heuristics from data. To this end, we present a novel data-driven technique that efficiently collects alarm-triggering traces, learns multiple candidate models, and adaptively chooses the best model tailored for each target program. We evaluate our approach with Infer and show that our technique significantly improves Infer's bug-finding efficiency for a range of open-source C programs."

    "abstract": "Knowing which parts of the source code will be defective can allow practitioners to better allocate testing resources. For this reason, many approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal. Most state-of-the-art predictive models rely on product and process metrics, i.e., they predict the defectiveness of a component by considering what developers did. However, there is still limited evidence of the benefits that can be achieved in this context by monitoring how developers complete a development task. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we aim at understanding whether measuring human aspects on developers while they write code can help predict the introduction of defects. First, we introduce a new developer-based model which relies on behavioral, psychophysical, and control factors that can be measured during the execution of development tasks. Then, we run a controlled experiment involving 20 software developers to understand if our developer-based model is able to predict the introduction of bugs. Our results show that a developer-based model is able to achieve a similar accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art code-based model, i.e., a model that uses only features measured from the source code. We also observed that by combining the models it is possible to obtain the best results (84% accuracy)."

Despite extensive efforts in testing DBMSs and verifying transaction processing mechanisms, isolation bugs still exist in widely-used DBMSs when these DBMSs violate their claimed transaction isolation levels. Isolation bugs can cause severe consequences, e.g., incorrect query results and database states. In this paper, we propose a novel transaction testing approach, Transaction oracle construction (Troc), to automatically detect isolation bugs in DBMSs. The core idea of Troc is to decouple a transaction into independent statements, and execute them on their own database views, which are constructed under the guidance of the claimed transaction isolation level. Any divergence between the actual transaction execution and the independent statement execution indicates an isolation bug. We implement and evaluate Troc on three widely-used DBMSs, i.e., MySQL, MariaDB, and TiDB. We have detected 5 previously-unknown isolation bugs in the latest versions of these DBMSs."

    "abstract": "Smalltalk, one of the first object-oriented programming languages, has had a tremendous influence on the evolution of computer technology. Due to the simplicity and productivity provided by the language, Smalltalk is still in active use today by many companies with large legacy codebases and with new code written every day. A crucial problem in Smalltalk programming is the race condition. Like in any other parallel language, debugging race conditions is inherently challenging, but in Smalltalk, it is even more challenging due to its dynamic nature. Being a purely dynamically-typed language, Smalltalk allows assigning any object to any variable without type restrictions, and allows forking new threads to execute arbitrary anonymous code blocks passed as objects. In Smalltalk, race conditions can be introduced easily, but are difficult to prevent at runtime. We present SmallRace, a novel static race detection framework designed for multithreaded dynamic languages, with a focus on Smalltalk. A key component of SmallRace is SmallIR, a subset of LLVM IR, in which all variables are declared with the same type-a generic pointer 18✶. This allows SmallRace to design an effective interprocedural thread-sensitive pointer analysis to infer the concrete types of dynamic variables. SmallRace automatically translates Smalltalk source code into SmallIR, supports most of the modern Smalltalk syntax in Visual Works, and generates actionable race reports with detailed debugging information. Importantly, SmallRace has been used to analyze a production codebase in a large company with over a million lines of code, and it has found tens of complex race conditions in the production code."

For example, companies can draw upon the life experiences of older women developers in order to better understand the needs of customers from a similar demographic.

    "abstract": "Testing Deep Learning (DL) based systems inherently requires large and representative test sets to evaluate whether DL systems generalise beyond their training datasets. Diverse Test Input Generators (TIGs) have been proposed to produce artificial inputs that expose issues of the DL systems by triggering misbehaviours. Unfortunately, such generated inputs may be invalid, i.e., not recognisable as part of the input domain, thus providing an unreliable quality assessment. Automated validators can ease the burden of manually checking the validity of inputs for human testers, although input validity is a concept difficult to formalise and, thus, automate. In this paper, we investigate to what extent TIGs can generate valid inputs, according to both automated and human validators. We conduct a large empirical study, involving 2 different automated validators, 220 human assessors, 5 different TIGs and 3 classification tasks. Our results show that 84% artificially generated inputs are valid, according to automated validators, but their expected label is not always preserved. Automated validators reach a good consensus with humans (78% accuracy), but still have limitations when dealing with feature-rich datasets."

As a result, more and more research efforts have been dedicated to testing DL libraries and frameworks. However, existing work largely overlooked one crucial component of any DL system, automatic differentiation (AD), which is the basis for the recent development of DL. To this end, we propose ∇Fuzz, the first general and practical approach specifically targeting the critical AD component in DL libraries. Our key insight is that each DL library API can be abstracted into a function processing tensors/vectors, which can be differentially tested under various execution scenarios (for computing outputs/gradients with different implementations). We have implemented $\\nabla \\text{Fuzz}$ as a fully automated API-level fuzzer targeting AD in DL libraries, which utilizes differential testing on different execution scenarios to test both first-order and high-order gradients, and also includes automated filtering strategies to remove false positives caused by numerical instability. We have performed an extensive study on four of the most popular and actively-maintained DL libraries, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and OneFlow. The result shows that $\\nabla \\text{Fuzz}$ substantially outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both code coverage and bug detection. To date, $\\nabla \\text{Fuzz}$ has detected 173 bugs for the studied DL libraries, with 144 already confirmed by developers (117 of which are previously unknown bugs and 107 are related to AD). Remarkably, $\\nabla \\text{Fuzz}$ contributed 58.3% (7/12) of all high-priority AD bugs for PyTorch and JAX during a two-month period. None of the confirmed AD bugs were detected by existing fuzzers."

In this paper, we propose a lightweight regression error reduction approach with two goals: 1) requiring no model retraining and even data, and 2) not sacrificing the accuracy. The proposed approach is built upon the key insight rooted in the unmanaged model uncertainty, which is intrinsic to DNN models, but has not been thoroughly explored especially in the context of quality assurance of DNN models. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective ensemble strategy that estimates and aligns the two models' uncertainty. We show that a Pareto improvement that reduces the regression errors without compromising the overall accuracy can be guaranteed in theory and largely achieved in practice. Comprehensive experiments with various representative models and datasets confirm that our approaches significantly outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives."

    "abstract": "Various deep neural network (DNN) coverage criteria have been proposed to assess DNN test inputs and steer input mutations. The coverage is characterized via neurons having certain outputs, or the discrepancy between neuron outputs. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that neuron coverage criteria show little correlation with test suite quality. In general, DNNs approximate distributions, by incorporating hierarchical layers, to make predictions for inputs. Thus, we champion to deduce DNN behaviors based on its approximated distributions from a layer perspective. A test suite should be assessed using its induced layer output distributions. Accordingly, to fully examine DNN behaviors, input mutation should be directed toward diversifying the approximated distributions. This paper summarizes eight design requirements for DNN coverage criteria, taking into account distribution properties and practical concerns. We then propose a new criterion, Neural Coverage (nlc),that satisfies all design requirements. NLC treats a single DNN layer as the basic computational unit (rather than a single neuron) and captures four critical properties of neuron output distributions. Thus, NL C accurately describes how DNNs comprehend inputs via approximated distributions. We demonstrate that NLC is significantly correlated with the diversity of a test suite across a number of tasks (classification and generation) and data formats (image and text). Its capacity to discover DNN prediction errors is promising. Test input mutation guided by NLC results in a greater quality and diversity of exposed erroneous behaviors."

Lax build maintenance can lead to costly build breakages or unexpected software behaviour. Code review is a broadly adopted practice to improve software quality. Yet, little is known about how code review is applied to build specifications. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of how code review is practiced in the context of build specifications. Through quantitative analysis of 502,931 change sets from the Qt and Eclipse communities, we observe that changes to build specifications are at least two times less frequently discussed during code review when compared to production and test code changes. A qualitative analysis of 500 change sets reveals that (i) comments on changes to build specifications are more likely to point out defects than rates reported in the literature for production and test code, and (ii) evolvability and dependency-related issues are the most frequently raised patterns of issues. Follow-up interviews with nine developers with 1–40 years of experience point out social and technical factors that hinder rigorous review of build specifications, such as a prevailing lack of understanding of and interest in build systems among developers, and the lack of dedicated tooling to support the code review of build specifications."

    "abstract": "Automated program repair is already deployed in industry, but concerns remain about repair quality. Recent research has shown that one of the main reasons repair tools produce incorrect (but seemingly correct) patches is imperfect fault localization (FL). This paper demonstrates that combining information from natural-language bug reports and test executions when localizing faults can have a significant positive impact on repair quality. For example, existing repair tools with such FL are able to correctly repair 7 defects in the Defects4J benchmark that no prior tools have repaired correctly. We develop, Blues, the first information-retrieval-based, statement-level FL technique that requires no training data. We further develop RAFL, the first unsupervised method for combining multiple FL techniques, which outperforms a supervised method. Using RAFL, we create SBIR by combining Blues with a spectrum-based (SBFL) technique. Evaluated on 815 real-world defects, SBIR consistently ranks buggy statements higher than its underlying techniques. We then modify three state-of-the-art repair tools, Arja, SequenceR, and SimFix, to use SBIR, SBFL, and Blues as their internal FL. We evaluate the quality of the produced patches on 689 real-world defects. Arja and SequenceR significantly benefit from SBIR: Arja using SBIR correctly repairs 28 defects, but only 21 using SBFL, and only 15 using Blues; SequenceR using SBIR correctly repairs 12 defects, but only 10 using SBFL, and only 4 using Blues. SimFix, (which has internal mechanisms to overcome poor FL), correctly repairs 30 defects using SBIR and SBFL, but only 13 using Blues. Our work is the first investigation of simultaneously using multiple software artifacts for automated program repair, and our promising findings suggest future research in this directions is likely to be fruitful."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172845",
    "abstract": "Code completion, a highly valuable topic in the software development domain, has been increasingly promoted for use by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). To date, visible LLM-based code completion frameworks such as GitHub Copilot and GPT are trained using deep learning over vast quantities of unstructured text and open source code. As the paramount component and the cornerstone in daily programming tasks, code completion has largely boosted professionals' efficiency in building real-world software systems. In contrast to this flourishing market, we find that code completion systems often output suspicious results, and to date, an automated testing and enhancement framework for code completion systems is not available. This research proposes CCTEST, a framework to test and repair code completion systems in black-box settings. CCTEST features a set of novel mutation strategies, namely program structure-consistent (PSC) mutations, to generate mutated code completion inputs. Then, it detects inconsistent outputs, representing possibly erroneous cases, from all the completed code cases. Moreover, CCTEST repairs the code completion outputs by selecting the output that mostly reflects the “average” appearance of all output cases, as the final output of the code completion systems. With around 18K test inputs, we detected 33,540 inputs that can trigger erroneous cases (with a true positive rate of 86%) from eight popular LLM-based code completion systems. With repairing, we show that the accuracy of code completion systems is notably increased by 40% and 67% with respect to BLEU score and Levenshtein edit similarity."

    "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) improves soft-ware reliability by generating patches for a buggy program automatically. Recent APR techniques leverage deep learning (DL) to build models to learn to generate patches from existing patches and code corpora. While promising, DL-based APR techniques suffer from the abundant syntactically or semantically incorrect patches in the patch space. These patches often disobey the syntactic and semantic domain knowledge of source code and thus cannot be the correct patches to fix a bug. We propose a DL-based APR approach KNOD, which in-corporates domain knowledge to guide patch generation in a direct and comprehensive way. KNOD has two major novelties, including (1) a novel three-stage tree decoder, which directly generates Abstract Syntax Trees of patched code according to the inherent tree structure, and (2) a novel domain-rule distillation, which leverages syntactic and semantic rules and teacher-student distributions to explicitly inject the domain knowledge into the decoding procedure during both the training and inference phases. We evaluate KNOD on three widely-used benchmarks. KNOD fixes 72 bugs on the Defects4J v1.2, 25 bugs on the QuixBugs, and 50 bugs on the additional Defects4J v2.0 benchmarks, outperforming all existing APR tools."

    "abstract": "A key challenge of automated program repair is finding correct patches in the vast search space of candidate patches. Real-world programs define large namespaces of variables that considerably contributes to the search space explosion. Existing program repair approaches neglect information about the program namespace, which makes them inefficient and increases the chance of test-overfitting. We propose Rete, a new program repair technique, that learns project-independent information about program namespace and uses it to navigate the search space of patches. Rete uses a neural network to extract project-independent information about variable CDU chains, def-use chains augmented with control flow. Then, it ranks patches by jointly ranking variables and the patch templates into which the variables are inserted. We evaluated Rete on 142 bugs extracted from two datasets, ManyBugs and BugsInPy. Our experiments demonstrate that ReTe generates six new correct patches that fix bugs that previous tools did not repair, an improvement of 31% and 59% over the existing state of the art."

    "abstract": "By virtue of being prevalently written in natural language (NL), requirements are prone to various defects, e.g., inconsistency and incompleteness. As such, requirements are frequently subject to quality assurance processes. These processes, when carried out entirely manually, are tedious and may further overlook important quality issues due to time and budget pressures. In this paper, we propose QAssist - a question-answering (QA) approach that provides automated assistance to stakeholders, including requirements engineers, during the analysis of NL requirements. Posing a question and getting an instant answer is beneficial in various quality-assurance scenarios, e.g., incompleteness detection. Answering requirements-related questions automatically is challenging since the scope of the search for answers can go beyond the given requirements specification. To that end, QAssist provides support for mining external domain-knowledge resources. Our work is one of the first initiatives to bring together QA and external domain knowledge for addressing requirements engineering challenges. We evaluate QAssist on a dataset covering three application domains and containing a total of 387 question-answer pairs. We experiment with state-of-the-art QA methods, based primarily on recent large-scale language models. In our empirical study, QAssist localizes the answer to a question to three passages within the requirements specification and within the external domain-knowledge resource with an average recall of 90.1% and 96.5%, respectively. QAssist extracts the actual answer to the posed question with an average accuracy of 84.2%."

This activity is common among developers, but little insight is available on its practical use, advantages and possible issues. This paper aims to empirically analyse this technique in a realistic scenario, in which it is used to extend the requirements of a product that were initially captured by means of more traditional requirements elicitation interviews. Considering this scenario, we conduct an experimental simulation with 58 analysts and collect qualitative data. We perform thematic analysis of the data to identify strategies, benefits, and challenges of app store-inspired elicitation, as well as differences with respect to interviews in the considered elicitation setting. Our results show that: (1) specific guidelines and procedures are required to better conduct app store-inspired elicitation; (2) current search features made available by app stores are not suitable for this practice, and more tool support is required to help analysts in the retrieval and evaluation of competing products; (3) while interviews focus on the why dimension of requirements engineering (i.e., goals), app store-inspired elicitation focuses on how (i.e., solutions), offering indications for implementation and improved usability. Our study provides a framework for researchers to address existing challenges and suggests possible benefits to fostering app store-inspired elicitation among practitioners."

The methods are implemented in a prototype tool, and experimental results on public benchmarks show its efficacy in proving non-termination as it outperforms state-of-the-art tools, both in terms of cases solved and performance.

    "abstract": "Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis and testing technique. Symbolic execution engines are usually implemented as interpreters, and the induced interpretation over-head can dramatically inhibit performance. Alternatively, implementation choices based on instrumentation provide a limited ability to transform programs. However, the use of compilation and code generation techniques beyond simple instrumentation remains underexplored for engine construction, leaving potential performance gains untapped. In this paper, we show how to tap some of these gains using sophisticated compilation techniques: We present Gensym, an optimizing symbolic-execution compiler that generates symbolic code which explores paths and generates tests in parallel. The key insight of GensYmis to compile symbolic execution tasks into cooperative concurrency via continuation-passing style, which further enables efficient parallelism. The design and implementation of Gensym is based on partial evaluation and generative programming techniques, which make it high-level and performant at the same time. We compare the performance of Gensym against the prior symbolic-execution compiler LLSC and the state-of-the-art symbolic interpreter KLEE. The results show an average 4.6× speedup for sequential execution and 9.4× speedup for parallel execution on 20 benchmark programs."

    "abstract": "Data races seriously threaten the correctness of concurrent programs. Earlier works can report false positives. Recently, trace-based predictive analysis has achieved sound results by inferring feasible traces based on sound partial orders or constraint solvers. However, they hold the same assumption: any read event may affect the control-flow of a predicted trace. Thus, being control-flow sensitive, they have to enforce any read event (in an inferred trace) to either read the same value or a value from the same event as that in the original trace, albeit some slightly relax this. This (even with relaxation) severely limits their predictive ability and many true data races can be missed. We introduce the concept of Fix-Point Event and propose a new partial order model. This allows us to not only predict races with witness traces (like existing works with no control-flow changes) but also soundly infer existences of witness traces with potential control-flow changes. Thus, we can achieve a higher concurrency coverage and detect more data races soundly. We have implemented above as a tool ToccRACE and conducted a set of experiments on a benchmark of seven real-world programs and a large-scale software MySQL, where MySQL produced 427 traces with a total size of 3.4TB. Compared with the state-of-the-art sound data race detector SeqCheck,ToccRACE is significantly more effective by detecting 84.4%/200% more unique/dynamic races on the benchmark programs and 52.22%/49.8% more unique/dynamic races on MySQL, incurring reasonable time and memory costs (about 1.1x×43.5x on the benchmark programs and 10x/1.03x on MySQL). Furthermore, ToccRACE is sound and is comnlcte on two threads."

Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play, and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool."

    "abstract": "With the continuous rise in the popularity of Android mobile devices, automated testing of apps has become more important than ever. Android apps are event-driven programs. Unfortunately, generating all possible types of events by interacting with an app's interface is challenging for an automated testing approach. Callback-driven testing eliminates the need for event generation by directly invoking app callbacks. However, existing callback-driven testing techniques assume prior knowledge of Android callbacks, and they rely on a human expert, who is familiar with the Android API, to write stub code that prepares callback arguments before invocation. Since the Android API is very large and keeps evolving, prior techniques could only support a small fraction of callbacks present in the Android framework. In this work, we introduce Columbus, a callback-driven testing technique that employs two strategies to eliminate the need for human involvement: (i) it automatically identifies callbacks by simultaneously analyzing both the Android framework and the app under test; (ii) it uses a combination of under-constrained symbolic execution (primitive arguments), and type-guided dynamic heap introspection (object arguments) to generate valid and effective inputs. Lastly, Columbus integrates two novel feedback mechanisms-data dependency and crash-guidance- during testing to increase the likelihood of triggering crashes and maximizing coverage. In our evaluation, Columbus outperforms state-of-the-art model-driven, checkpoint-based, and callback-driven testing tools both in terms of crashes and coverage."

    "abstract": "Continuous game quality assurance is of great importance to satisfy the increasing demands of users. To respond to game issues reported by users timely, game com-panies often create and maintain a large number of releases, updates, and tweaks in a short time. Regression testing is an essential technique adopted to detect regression issues during the evolution of the game software. However, due to the special characteristics of game software (e.g., frequent updates and long-running tests), traditional regression testing techniques are not directly applicable. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we perform an early exploratory study to investigate the challenges in regression testing of video games. We first performed empirical studies to better understand the game development process, bugs introduced during game evolution, and the context sensitivity. Based on the results of the study, we proposed the first regression test selection (RTS) technique for game software, which is a compromise between safety and practicality. In particular, we model the test suite of game software as a State Transition Graph (STG) and then perform the RTS on the STG. We establish the dependencies between the states/actions of STG and game files, including game art resources, game design files, and source code, and perform change impact analysis to identify the states/actions (in the STG) that potentially execute such changes. We implemented our framework in a tool, named GameRTS, and evaluated its usefulness on 10 tasks of a large-scale commercial game, including a total of 1,429 commits over three versions. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of GameRTS in game RTS. For most tasks, GameRTS only selected one trace from STG, which can significantly reduce the testing time. Furthermore, GameRTS detects all the regression bugs from the test evaluation suites. Compared with the file-level RTS, GameRTS selected fewer states/actions/traces (i.e., 13.77%, 23.97%, 6.85%). In addition, GameRTS identified 2 new critical regression bugs in the game."

The main idea of this paper is to explore characteristics affecting developer preferences for interactions between humans and bots, in the context of GitHub pull requests. We carried out an exploratory sequential study with interviews and a subsequent vignette-based survey. We find developers generally prefer bots that are personable but show little autonomy, however, more experienced developers tend to prefer more autonomous bots.

Unfortunately, the NPM dependency solver has several shortcomings. 1) NPM is greedy and often fails to install the newest versions of dependencies; 2) NPM's algorithm leads to duplicated dependencies and bloated code, which is particularly bad for web applications that need to minimize code size; 3) NPM's vulnerability fixing algorithm is also greedy, and can even introduce new vulnerabilities; and 4) NPM's ability to duplicate dependencies can break stateful frameworks and requires a lot of care to workaround. Although existing tools try to address these problems they are either brittle, rely on post hoc changes to the dependency tree, do not guarantee optimality, or are not composable.

We use Pacsolve to build Maxnpm, a complete, drop-in replacement for NPM, which empowers developers to combine multiple objectives when installing dependencies.

Firstly, this work is the first to evaluate ten CLMs on four APR benchmarks, which shows that surprisingly, the best CLM, as is, fixes 72% more bugs than the state-of-the-art deep-learning (DL)-based APR techniques. Secondly, one of the four APR benchmarks was created by us in this paper to avoid data leaking for a fair evaluation. Thirdly, it is the first work to fine-tune CLMs with APR training data, which shows that fine-tuning brings 31%-1,267% improvement to CLMs and enables them to fix 46%-164 % more bugs than existing DL-based APR techniques. Fourthly, this work studies the impact of buggy lines, showing that CLMs, as is, cannot make good use of the buggy lines to fix bugs, yet fine-tuned CLMs could potentially over-rely on buggy lines. Lastly, this work analyzes the size, time, and memory efficiency of different CLMs. This work shows promising directions for the APR domain, such as fine-tuning CLMs with APR-specific designs, and also raises awareness of fair and comprehensive evaluations of CLMs and calls for more transparent reporting of open-source repositories used in the pre-training data to address the data leaking problem."

With the development of deep learning, lots of DL-based APR approaches have been proposed using an encoder-decoder architecture. Despite the promising performance, these models share the same limitation: generating lots of untypable patches. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the existing models do not consider the constraints of code captured by a set of typing rules. In this paper, we propose, Tare, a type-aware model for neural program repair to learn the typing rules. To encode an individual typing rule, we introduce three novel components: (1) a novel type of grammars, T-Grammar, that integrates the type information into a standard grammar, (2) a novel representation of code, T-Graph, that integrates the key information needed for type checking an AST, and (3) a novel type-aware neural program repair approach, Tare, that encodes the T-Graph and generates the patches guided by T-Grammar. The experiment was conducted on three benchmarks, 393 bugs from Defects4J v1.2, 444 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, and 40 bugs from QuixBugs. Our results show that Tare repairs 62, 32, and 27 bugs on these benchmarks respectively, and outperforms the existing APR approaches on all benchmarks. Further analysis also shows that Tare tends to generate more compilable patches than the existing DL-based APR approaches with the typing rule information."

However, there are still disadvantages in both methods. The template-based methods cannot fix the bugs whose types are beyond the capabilities of the templates and only use the syntax information to guide the patch synthesis, while the NMT-based methods intend to generate the small range of fixed code for better performance and may suffer from the OOV (Out-of-vocabulary) problem. To solve these problems, we propose a novel template-based neural program repair approach called TENURE to combine the template-based and NMT- based methods. First, we build two large-scale datasets for 35 fix templates from template-based method and one special fix template (single-line code generation) from NMT-based method, respectively. Second, the encoder-decoder models are adopted to learn deep semantic features for generating patch intermediate representations (IRs) for different templates. The optimized copy mechanism is also used to alleviate the OOV problem. Third, based on the combined patch IRs for different templates, three tools are developed to recover real patches from the patch IRs, replace the unknown tokens, and filter the patch candidates with compilation errors by leveraging the project-specific information. On Defects4J-vl.2, TENURE can fix 79 bugs and 52 bugs with perfect and Ochiai fault localization, respectively. It is able to repair 50 and 32 bugs as well on Defects4J-v2.0.

    "abstract": "Large language models such as Codex, have shown the capability to produce code for many programming tasks. However, the success rate of existing models is low, especially for complex programming tasks. One of the reasons is that language models lack awareness of program semantics, resulting in incorrect programs, or even programs which do not compile. In this paper, we systematically study whether automated program repair (APR) techniques can fix the incorrect solutions produced by language models in LeetCode contests. The goal is to study whether APR techniques can enhance reliability in the code produced by large language models. Our study revealed that: (1) automatically generated code shares common programming mistakes with human-crafted solutions, indicating APR techniques may have potential to fix auto-generated code; (2) given bug location information provided by a statistical fault localization approach, the newly released Codex edit mode, which supports editing code, is similar to or better than existing Java repair tools TBar and Recoder in fixing incorrect solutions. By analyzing the experimental results generated by these tools, we provide several suggestions: (1) enhancing APR tools to surpass limitations in patch space (e.g., introducing more flexible fault localization) is desirable; (2) as large language models can derive more fix patterns by training on more data, future APR tools could shift focus from adding more fix patterns to synthesis/semantics based approaches, (3) combination of language models with APR to curate patch ingredients, is worth studying."

    "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to help developers automatically patch software bugs. However, current state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based APR techniques face the problem of limited patch variety, failing to fix complicated bugs. This is mainly due to the reliance on bug-fixing datasets to craft fix templates (traditional) or directly predict potential patches (learning-based). Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can potentially help avoid this issue. Very recently, researchers have directly leveraged LLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets. Meanwhile, such existing work either failed to include state-of-the-art LLMs or was not evaluated on realistic datasets. Thus, the true power of modern LLMs on the important APR problem is yet to be revealed. In this work, we perform the first extensive study on directly applying LLMs for APR. We select 9 recent state-of-the-art LLMs, including both generative and infilling models, ranging from 125M to 20B in size. We designed 3 different repair settings to evaluate the different ways we can use LLMs to generate patches: 1) generate the entire patch function, 2) fill in a chunk of code given the prefix and suffix 3) output a single line fix. We apply the LLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3 different languages and compare different LLMs in the number of bugs fixed, generation speed and compilation rate. We also compare the LLMs against recent state-of-the-art APR tools. Our study demonstrates that directly applying state-of-the-art LLMs can already substantially outperform all existing APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied LLMs, the scaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better performance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy line (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more fixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation, the LLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can even be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking. Lastly, we show that LLM-based APR can be further substantially boosted via: 1) increasing the sample size, and 2) incorporating fix template information."

    "abstract": "The usage of Python idioms is popular among Python developers in a formative study of 101 Python idiom performance related questions on Stack Overflow, we find that developers often get confused about the performance impact of Python idioms and use anecdotal toy code or rely on personal project experience which is often contradictory in performance outcomes. There has been no large-scale, systematic empirical evidence to reconcile these performance debates. In the paper, we create a large synthetic dataset with 24,126 pairs of non-idiomatic and functionally-equivalent idiomatic code for the nine unique Python idioms identified in [1], and reuse a large real-project dataset of 54,879 such code pairs provided in [1]. We develop a reliable performance measurement method to compare the speedup or slowdown by idiomatic code against non-idiomatic counterpart, and analyze the performance discrepancies between the synthetic and real-project code, the relationships between code features and performance changes, and the root causes of performance changes at the bytecode level. We summarize our findings as some actionable suggestions for using Python idioms."

    "abstract": "To create unit tests, it may be necessary to refactor the production code, e.g. by widening access to specific methods or by decomposing classes into smaller units that are easier to test independently. We report on an extensive study to understand such composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of improving testability. We collected and studied 346,841 java pull requests from 621 GitHub projects. First, we compared the atomic refactorings in two populations: pull requests with changed test-pairs (i.e. with co-changes in production and test code and thus potentially including testability refactoring) and pull requests without test-pairs. We found significantly more atomic refactorings in test-pairs pull requests, such as Change Variable Type Operation or Change Parameter Type. Second, we manually analyzed the code changes of 200 pull requests, where developers explicitly mention the terms “testability” or “refactor + test”. We identified ten composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of testability, which we call testability refactoring patterns. Third, we manually analyzed additional 524 test-pairs pull requests: both randomly selected and where we assumed to find testability refactorings, e.g. in pull requests about dependency or concurrency issues. About 25% of all analyzed pull requests actually included testability refactoring patterns. The most frequent were extract a method for override or for invocation, widen access to a method for invocation, and extract a class for invocation. We also report on frequent atomic refactorings which co-occur with the patterns and discuss the implications of our findings for research, practice, and education."

    "abstract": "Developers want to detect bugs as early in the development lifecycle as possible, as the effort and cost to fix them increases with the incremental development of features. Ultimately, bugs that are only found in production can have catastrophic consequences. Type systems are effective at detecting many classes of bugs during development, often providing immediate feedback both at compile-time and while typing due to editor integration. Unfortunately, more powerful static and dynamic analysis tools do not have the same success due to providing false positives, not being immediate, or not being integrated into the language. Liquid Types extend the language type system with predicates, augmenting the classes of bugs that the compiler or IDE can catch compared to the simpler type systems available in mainstream programming languages. However, previous implementations of Liquid Types have not used human-centered methods for designing or evaluating their extensions. Therefore, this paper investigates how Liquid Types can be integrated into a mainstream programming language, Java, by proposing a new design that aims to lower the barriers to entry and adapts to problems that Java developers commonly encounter at runtime. Following a participatory design methodology, we conducted a developer survey to design the syntax of LiquidJava, our prototype. To evaluate if the added effort to writing Liquid Types in Java would convince users to adopt them, we conducted a user study with 30 Java developers. The results show that LiquidJava helped users detect and fix more bugs and that Liquid Types are easy to interpret and learn with few resources. At the end of the study, all users reported interest in adopting LiquidJava for their projects."

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) software has been widely adopted in modern society, with reported fairness implications for minority groups based on race, sex, age, etc. Many recent works have proposed methods to measure and mitigate algorithmic bias in ML models. The existing approaches focus on single classifier-based ML models. However, real-world ML models are often composed of multiple independent or dependent learners in an ensemble (e.g., Random Forest), where the fairness composes in a non-trivial way. How does fairness compose in ensembles? What are the fairness impacts of the learners on the ultimate fairness of the ensemble? Can fair learners result in an unfair ensemble? Furthermore, studies have shown that hyperparameters influence the fairness of ML models. Ensemble hyperparameters are more complex since they affect how learners are combined in different categories of ensembles. Understanding the impact of ensemble hyperparameters on fairness will help programmers design fair ensembles. Today, we do not understand these fully for different ensemble algorithms. In this paper, we comprehensively study popular real-world ensembles: Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting. We have developed a benchmark of 168 ensemble models collected from Kaggle on four popular fairness datasets. We use existing fairness metrics to understand the composition of fairness. Our results show that ensembles can be designed to be fairer without using mitigation techniques. We also identify the interplay between fairness composition and data characteristics to guide fair ensemble design. Finally, our benchmark can be leveraged for further research on fair ensembles. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first and largest studies on fairness composition in ensembles yet presented in the literature."

    "abstract": "Fairness of machine learning (ML) software has become a major concern in the recent past. Although recent research on testing and improving fairness have demonstrated impact on real-world software, providing fairness guarantee in practice is still lacking. Certification of ML models is challenging because of the complex decision-making process of the models. In this paper, we proposed Fairify, an SMT-based approach to verify individual fairness property in neural network (NN) models. Individual fairness ensures that any two similar individuals get similar treatment irrespective of their protected attributes e.g., race, sex, age. Verifying this fairness property is hard because of the global checking and non-linear computation nodes in NN. We proposed sound approach to make individual fairness verification tractable for the developers. The key idea is that many neurons in the NN always remain inactive when a smaller part of the input domain is considered. So, Fairify leverages white-box access to the models in production and then apply formal analysis based pruning. Our approach adopts input partitioning and then prunes the NN for each partition to provide fairness certification or counterexample. We leveraged interval arithmetic and activation heuristic of the neurons to perform the pruning as necessary. We evaluated Fairify on 25 real-world neural networks collected from four different sources, and demonstrated the effectiveness, scalability and performance over baseline and closely related work. Fairify is also configurable based on the domain and size of the NN. Our novel formulation of the problem can answer targeted verification queries with relaxations and counterexamples, which have practical implications."

    "abstract": "Interpreting and debugging machine learning models is necessary to ensure the robustness of the machine learning models. Explaining mispredictions can help significantly in doing so. While recent works on misprediction explanation have proven promising in generating interpretable explanations for mispredictions, the state-of-the-art techniques “blindly” deduce misprediction explanation rules from all data features, which may not be scalable depending on the number of features. To alleviate this problem, we propose an efficient misprediction explanation technique named Bias Guided Misprediction Diagnoser (BGMD), which leverages two prior knowledge about data: a) data often exhibit highly-skewed feature distributions and b) trained models in many cases perform poorly on subdataset with under-represented features. Next, we propose a technique named MAPS (Mispredicted Area UPweight Sampling). MAPS increases the weights of subdataset during model retraining that belong to the group that is prone to be mispredicted because of containing under-represented features. Thus, MAPS make retrained model pay more attention to the under-represented features. Our empirical study shows that our proposed BGMD outperformed the state-of-the-art misprediction diagnoser and reduces diagnosis time by 92%. Furthermore, MAPS outperformed two state-of-the-art techniques on fixing the machine learning model's performance on mispredicted data without compromising performance on all data. All the research artifacts (i.e., tools, scripts, and data) of this study are available in the accompanying website [1]."

    "abstract": "The deep feedforward neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in socioeconomic critical decision support software systems. DNNs are exceptionally good at finding min-imal, sufficient statistical patterns within their training data. Consequently, DNNs may learn to encode decisions-amplifying existing biases or introducing new ones-that may disadvantage protected individuals/groups and may stand to violate legal protections. While the existing search based software testing approaches have been effective in discovering fairness defects, they do not supplement these defects with debugging aids-such as severity and causal explanations-crucial to help developers triage and decide on the next course of action. Can we measure the severity of fairness defects in DNNs? Are these defects symptomatic of improper training or they merely reflect biases present in the training data? To answer such questions, we present Dice: an information-theoretic testing and debugging framework to discover and localize fairness defects in DNNs. The key goal of Dice is to assist software developers in triaging fairness defects by ordering them by their severity. Towards this goal, we quantify fairness in terms of protected information (in bits) used in decision making. A quantitative view of fairness defects not only helps in ordering these defects, our empirical evaluation shows that it improves the search efficiency due to resulting smoothness of the search space. Guided by the quan-titative fairness, we present a causal debugging framework to localize inadequately trained layers and neurons responsible for fairness defects. Our experiments over ten DNNs, developed for socially critical tasks, show that Dice efficiently characterizes the amounts of discrimination, effectively generates discriminatory instances (vis-a-vis the state-of-the-art techniques), and localizes layers/neurons with significant biases."

    "abstract": "The privacy of personal information has received significant attention in mobile software. Although researchers have designed methods to identify the conflict between app behavior and privacy policies, little is known about the privacy compliance issues relevant to third-party libraries (TPLs). The regulators enacted articles to regulate the usage of personal information for TPLs (e.g., the CCPA requires businesses clearly notify consumers if they share consumers' data with third parties or not). However, it remains challenging to investigate the privacy compliance issues of TPLs due to three reasons: 1) Difficulties in collecting TPLs' privacy policies. In contrast to Android apps, which are distributed through markets like Google Play and must provide privacy policies, there is no unique platform for collecting privacy policies of TPLs. 2) Difficulties in analyzing TPL's user privacy access behaviors. TPLs are mainly provided in binary files, such as jar or aar, and their whole functionalities usually cannot be executed independently without host apps. 3) Difficulties in identifying consistency between TPL's functionalities and privacy policies, and host app's privacy policy and data sharing with TPLs. This requires analyzing not only the privacy policies of TPLs and host apps but also their functionalities. In this paper, we propose an automated system named ATPChecker to analyze whether Android TPLs comply with the privacy-related regulations. We construct a data set that contains a list of 458 TPLs, 247 TPL's privacy policies, 187 TPL's binary files and 641 host apps and their privacy policies. Then, we analyze the bytecode of TPLs and host apps, design natural language processing systems to analyze privacy policies, and implement an expert system to identify TPL usage-related regulation compliance. The experimental results show that 23% TPLs violate regulation requirements for providing privacy policies. Over 47% TPLs miss disclosing data usage in their privacy policies. Over 65% host apps share user data with TPLs while 65% of them miss disclosing interactions with TPLs. Our findings remind developers to be mindful of TPL usage when developing apps or writing privacy policies to avoid violating regulations,"

In practice, however, the requirements links are frequently absent or incorrectly labeled, and reconstructing such ties is time-consuming and error-prone. Numerous learning-based approaches have been put forth to address the problem. However, these approaches will lose effectiveness for the Cold-Start projects with few labeled samples. To this end, we propose RADIATION, an adversarial-based domain adaptation approach for cross-domain requirements linking. Generally, RADIATION firstly adopts an IDF-based Masking strategy to filter the domain-specific features. Then it pre-trains a linking model in the source domain with sufficient labeled samples and adapts the model to target domains using a distance-enhanced adversarial technique without using any labeled target samples. Evaluation on five public datasets shows that RADIATION could achieve 66.4% precision, 89.2% recall, and significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 13.4% -42.9% F1. In addition, the designed components, i.e., IDF-based Masking and Distance-enhanced Loss, could significantly improve performance."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172883",
    "abstract": "Software security research has a core problem: it is impossible to prove the security of complex software. A low number of known defects may simply indicate that the software has not been attacked yet, or that successful attacks have not been detected. A high defect count may be the result of white-hat hacker targeting, or of a successful bug bounty program which prevented insecurities from persisting in the wild. This makes it difficult to measure the security of non-trivial software. Researchers instead usually measure effort directed towards ensuring software security. However, different researchers use their own tailored measures, usually devised from industry secure coding guidelines. Not only is there no agreed way to measure effort, there is also no agreement on what effort entails. Qualitative studies emphasise the importance of security culture in an organisation. Where software security practices are introduced solely to ensure compliance with legislative or industry standards, a box-ticking attitude to security may result. The security culture may be weak or non-existent, making it likely that precautions not explicitly mentioned in the standards will be missed. Thus, researchers need both a way to assess software security practice and a way to measure software security culture. To assess security practice, we converted the empirically-established 12 most common software security activities into questions. To assess security culture, we devised a number of questions grounded in prior literature. We ran a secure development survey with both sets of questions, obtaining organic responses from 1,100 software coders in 59 countries. We used proven common activities to assess security practice, and made a first attempt to quantitatively assess aspects of security culture in the broad developer population. Our results show that some coders still work in environments where there is little to no attempt to ensure code security. Security practice and culture do not always correlate, and some organisations with strong secure coding practice have weak secure coding culture. This may lead to problems in defect prevention and sustained software security effort."

The goal of our paper is to aid researchers and tool developers in understanding and prioritizing opportunities for future research and tool automation for mitigating checked-in secrets through an empirical investigation of challenges and solutions related to checked-in secrets. We extract 779 questions related to checked-in secrets on Stack Exchange and apply qualitative analysis to determine the challenges and the solutions posed by others for each of the challenges. We identify 27 challenges and 13 solutions. The four most common challenges, in ranked order, are: (i) store/version of secrets during deployment; (ii) store/version of secrets in source code; (iii) ignore/hide of secrets in source code; and (iv) sanitize VCS history. The three most common solutions, in ranked order, are: (i) move secrets out of source code/version control and use template config file; (ii) secret management in deployment; and (iii) use local environment variables. Our findings indicate that the same solution has been mentioned to mitigate multiple challenges.

    "abstract": "Intel's SGX is a confidential computing technique. It allows key functionalities of C/C++/native applications to be confidentially executed in hardware enclaves. However, numerous cloud applications are written in Java. For supporting their confidential computing, state-of-the-art approaches deploy Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) in enclaves and perform confidential computing on JVMs. Meanwhile, these JVM-in-enclave solutions still suffer from serious limitations, such as heavy overheads of running JVMs in enclaves, large attack surfaces, and deep computation stacks. To mitigate the above limitations, we for-malize a Secure Closed-World (SCW) principle and then propose Lejacon, a lightweight and efficient approach to Java confidential computing. The key idea is, given a Java application, to (1) separately compile its confidential computing tasks into a bundle of Native Confidential Computing (NCC) services; (2) run the NCC services in enclaves on the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) side, and meanwhile run the non-confidential code on a JVM on the Rich Execution Environment (REE) side. The two sides interact with each other, protecting confidential computing tasks and as well keeping the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size small. We implement Lejacon and evaluate it against OcclumJ (a state-of-the-art JVM-in-enclave solution) on a set of benchmarks using the BouncyCastle cryptography library. The evaluation results clearly show the strengths of Lejacon: it achieves compet-itive performance in running Java confidential code in enclaves; compared with OcclumJ, Lejacon achieves speedups by up to 16.2x in running confidential code and also reduces the TCB sizes by 90+% on average."

Current techniques identify vulnerabilities from source code using static and dynamic analyses. However, this does not help integrate security mechanisms early in the architectural design phase. We develop VDocScan, a technique for predicting vulnerabilities based on specification documents, even before the development stage. We evaluate VDocScan using an extensive dataset of CVE vulnerability reports mapped to over 3600 product documentations. An evaluation of 8 CWE vulnerability pillars shows that even interpretable whitebox classifiers predict vulnerabilities with up to 61.1% precision and 78% recall. Further, using strategies to improve the relevance of extracted keywords, addressing class imbalance, segregating products into categories such as Operating Systems, Web applications, and Hardware, and using blackbox ensemble models such as the random forest classifier improves the performance to 96% precision and 91.1% recall. The high precision and recall shows that VDocScan can anticipate vulnerabilities detected in a product's lifetime ahead of time during the Design phase to incorporate necessary security mechanisms. The performance is consistently high for vulnerabilities with the mode of introduction: architecture and design."

    "abstract": "Mobile device vendors develop their customized Android OS (termed downstream) based on Google Android (termed upstream) to support new features. During daily independent development, the downstream also periodically merges changes of a new release from the upstream into its development branches, keeping in sync with the upstream. Due to a large number of commits to be merged, heavy code conflicts would be reported if auto-merge operations failed. Prior work has studied conflicts in this scenario. However, it is still unclear about the coupling between the downstream and the upstream (We term this coupling as the dependency facade), as well as how merge conflicts are related to this coupling. To address this issue, we first propose the DepFCD to reveal the dependency facade from three aspects, including interface-level dependencies that indicate a clear design boundary, intrusion-level dependencies which blur the boundary, and dependency constraints imposed by the upstream non-SDK restrictions. We then empirically investigate these three aspects (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3) and merge conflicts (RQ4) on the dependency facade. To support the study, we collect four open-source downstream projects and one industrial project, with 15 downstream and 15 corresponding upstream versions. Our study reveals interesting observations and suggests earlier mitigation of merge conflicts through a well-managed dependency facade. Our study will benefit the research about the coupling between upstream and downstream as well as the downstream maintenance practice."

    "abstract": "Today's software failures have two dominating root causes: code bugs and misconfigurations. To combat failure-inducing software changes, unified regression testing (URT) is needed to synergistically test the changed code and all changed production configurations for deployment reliability. However, URT could incur high cost, as it needs to run a large number of tests under multiple configurations. Regression test selection (RTS) can reduce regression testing cost. Unfortunately, no existing RTS technique reasons about code and configuration changes collectively. We introduce Unified Regression Test Selection (uRTS) to effectively reduce the cost of URT. uRTS supports project changes on 1) code only, 2) configurations only, and 3) both code and configurations. It selects regular tests and configuration tests with a unified selection algorithm. The uRTS algorithm analyzes code and configuration dependencies of each test across runs and across configurations. uRTS provides the same safety guarantee as the state-of-the-art RTS while selecting fewer tests and, more importantly, reducing the end-to-end testing time. We implemented uRTS on top of Ekstazi (a RTS tool for code changes) and Ctest (a configuration testing framework). We evaluate uRTS on hundreds of code revisions and dozens of configurations of five large projects. The results show that uRTS reduces the end-to-end testing time, on average, by 3.64X compared to executing all tests and 1.87X compared to a competitive reference solution that directly extends RTS for URT."

    "abstract": "Executing large test suites is time and resource consuming, sometimes impossible, and such test suites typically contain many redundant test cases. Hence, test case (suite) minimization is used to remove redundant test cases that are unlikely to detect new faults. However, most test case minimization techniques rely on code coverage (white-box), model-based features, or requirements specifications, which are not always (entirely) accessible by test engineers. Code coverage analysis also leads to scalability issues, especially when applied to large industrial systems. Recently, a set of novel techniques was proposed, called FAST-R, relying solely on test case code for test case minimization, which appeared to be much more efficient than white-box techniques. However, it achieved a comparable low fault detection capability for Java projects, thus making its application challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose ATM (AST-based Test case Minimizer), a similarity-based, search-based test case minimization technique, taking a specific budget as input, that also relies exclusively on the source code of test cases but attempts to achieve higher fault detection through finer-grained similarity analysis and a dedicated search algorithm. ATM transforms test case code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and relies on four tree-based similarity measures to apply evolutionary search, specifically genetic algorithms, to minimize test cases. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of ATM on a large dataset of 16 Java projects with 661 faulty versions using three budgets ranging from 25% to 75% of test suites. ATM achieved significantly higher fault detection rates (0.82 on average), compared to FAST-R (0.61 on average) and random minimization (0.52 on average), when running only 50% of the test cases, within practically acceptable time (1.1 - 4.3 hours, on average, per project version), given that minimization is only occasionally applied when many new test cases are created (major releases). Results achieved for other budgets were consistent."

While structural coverage has several benefits, previous studies suggested that code coverage is not a good indicator of a test suite's fault-detection effectiveness as coverage computation does not consider test oracle quality. In this research, we formally define the coverage gap in structural testing as the percentage of program structure that is executed but not observed by any test oracles. Our large-scale empirical study of 13 Java applications, 16K test cases and 51.6K test assertions shows that even for mature test suites, the gap can be as high as 51 percentage points (pp) and 34pp on average. Our study reveals that the coverage gap strongly and negatively correlates with a test suite's fault-detection effectiveness. To mitigate gaps, we propose a lightweight static analysis of program dependencies to produce a ranked recommendation of test focus methods that can reduce the gap and improve test suite quality. When considering 34.8K assertions in the test suite as ground truth, the recommender suggests two-thirds of the focus methods written by developers within the top five recommendations."

    "abstract": "Prompt and accurate detection of system anomalies is essential to ensure the reliability of software systems. Unlike manual efforts that exploit all available run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a single type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make effective use of the joint information among different types of data. Consequently, many false predictions occur. To better understand the manifestations of system anomalies, we conduct a systematical study on a large amount of heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates that logs and metrics can manifest system anomalies collaboratively and complementarily, and neither of them only is sufficient. Thus, integrating heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a system's health status. In this context, we propose Hades, the first end-to-end semi-supervised approach to effectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data. Our approach employs a hierarchical architecture to learn a global representation of the system status by fusing log semantics and metric patterns. It captures discriminative features and meaningful interactions from heterogeneous data via a cross-modal attention module, trained in a semi-supervised manner. We evaluate Hades extensively on large-scale simulated data and datasets from Huawei Cloud. The experimental results present the effectiveness of our model in detecting system anomalies. We also release the code and the annotated dataset for replication and future research."

In this work, we do the first large-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of these models for helping engineers root cause and mitigate production incidents. We do a rigorous study at Microsoft, on more than 40,000 incidents and compare several large language models in zero-shot, fine-tuned and multi-task setting using semantic and lexical metrics.

    "abstract": "The complexity and dynamism of microservices pose significant challenges to system reliability, and thereby, automated troubleshooting is crucial. Effective root cause localization after anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of microservice systems. However, two significant issues rest in existing approaches: (1) Microservices generate traces, system logs, and key performance indicators (KPIs), but existing approaches usually consider traces only, failing to understand the system fully as traces cannot depict all anomalies; (2) Troubleshooting microservices generally contains two main phases, i.e., anomaly detection and root cause localization. Existing studies regard these two phases as independent, ignoring their close correlation. Even worse, inaccurate detection results can deeply affect localization effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Eadro, the first end-to-end framework to integrate anomaly detection and root cause localization based on multi-source data for troubleshooting large-scale microservices. The key insights of Eadro are the anomaly manifestations on different data sources and the close connection between detection and localization. Thus, Eadro models intra-service behaviors and inter-service dependencies from traces, logs, and KPIs, all the while leveraging the shared knowledge of the two phases via multi-task learning. Experiments on two widely-used benchmark microservices demonstrate that Eadro outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results also show the usefulness of integrating multi-source data. We also release our code and data to facilitate future research."

    "abstract": "Modern systems generate a massive amount of logs to detect and diagnose system faults, which incurs expensive storage costs and runtime overhead. After investigating real-world production logs, we observe that most of the logging overhead is due to a small number of log templates, referred to as log hotspots. Therefore, we conduct a systematical study about log hotspots in an industrial system WeChat, which motivates us to identify log hotspots and reduce them on the fly. In this paper, we propose LogReducer, a non-intrusive and language-independent log reduction framework based on eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter), consisting of both online and offline processes. After two months of serving the offline process of LogReducer in WeChat, the log storage overhead has dropped from 19.7 PB per day to 12.0 PB (i.e., about a 39.08% decrease). Practical implementation and experimental evaluations in the test environment demonstrate that the online process of LogReducer can control the logging overhead of hotspots while preserving logging effectiveness. Moreover, the log hotspot handling time can be reduced from an average of 9 days in production to 10 minutes in the test with the help of LogReducer,"

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) plays a more and more important role in our daily life due to its competitive performance in industrial application domains. As the core of DL-enabled systems, deep neural networks (DNNs) need to be carefully evaluated to ensure the produced models match the expected requirements. In practice, the de facto standard to assess the quality of DNNs in the industry is to check their performance (accuracy) on a collected set of labeled test data. However, preparing such labeled data is often not easy partly because of the huge labeling effort, i.e., data labeling is labor-intensive, especially with the massive new incoming unlabeled data every day. Recent studies show that test selection for DNN is a promising direction that tackles this issue by selecting minimal representative data to label and using these data to assess the model. However, it still requires human effort and cannot be automatic. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, named Aries, that can estimate the performance of DNNs on new unlabeled data using only the information obtained from the original test data. The key insight behind our technique is that the model should have similar prediction accuracy on the data which have similar distances to the decision boundary. We performed a large-scale evaluation of our technique on two famous datasets, CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet, four widely studied DNN models including ResNetl0l and DenseNetl21, and 13 types of data transformation methods. Results show that the estimated accuracy by Aries is only 0.03% - 2.60% off the true accuracy. Besides, Aries also outperforms the state-of-the-art labeling-free methods in 50 out of 52 cases and selection-labeling-based methods in 96 out of 128 cases."

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) testing approaches have grown fast in recent years to test the correctness and robustness of DNNs. In particular, DNN coverage criteria are frequently used to evaluate the quality of a test suite, and a number of coverage criteria based on neuron-wise, layer-wise, and path-/trace-wise coverage patterns have been published to date. However, we see that existing criteria are insufficient to represent how one neuron would influence subsequent neurons; hence, we lack a concept of how neurons, when functioning as causes and effects, might jointly make a DNN prediction. Given recent advances in interpreting DNN internals using causal inference, we present the first causality-aware DNN coverage criterion, which evaluates a test suite by quantifying the extent to which the suite provides new causal relations for testing DNNs. Performing standard causal inference on DNNs presents both theoretical and practical hurdles. We introduce CC (causal coverage), a practical and efficient coverage criterion that integrates a set of optimizations using DNN domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the efficacy of CC using diverse, real-world inputs and adversarial inputs, such as adversarial examples (AEs) and backdoor inputs. We demonstrate that CC outperforms previous DNN criteria under various settings with moderate cost."

    "abstract": "Testing Machine Learning (ML) projects is challenging due to inherent non-determinism of various ML algorithms and the lack of reliable ways to compute reference results. Developers typically rely on their intuition when writing tests to check whether ML algorithms produce accurate results. However, this approach leads to conservative choices in selecting assertion bounds for comparing actual and expected results in test assertions. Because developers want to avoid false positive failures in tests, they often set the bounds to be too loose, potentially leading to missing critical bugs. We present FASER - the first systematic approach for balancing the trade-off between the fault-detection effectiveness and flakiness of non-deterministic tests by computing optimal assertion bounds. FASER frames this trade-off as an optimization problem between these competing objectives by varying the assertion bound. FASER leverages 1) statistical methods to estimate the flakiness rate, and 2) mutation testing to estimate the fault-detection effectiveness. We evaluate FASER on 87 non-deterministic tests collected from 22 popular ML projects. FASER finds that 23 out of 87 studied tests have conservative bounds and proposes tighter assertion bounds that maximizes the fault-detection effectiveness of the tests while limiting flakiness. We have sent 19 pull requests to developers, each fixing one test, out of which 14 pull requests have already been accepted."

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used to perform real-world tasks in cyber-physical systems such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the correct behavior of such DNN-Enabled Systems (DES) is a crucial topic. Online testing is one of the promising modes for testing such systems with their application environments (simulated or real) in a closed loop, taking into account the continuous interaction between the systems and their environments. However, the environmental variables (e.g., lighting conditions) that might change during the systems' operation in the real world, causing the DES to violate requirements (safety, functional), are often kept constant during the execution of an online test scenario due to the two major challenges: (1) the space of all possible scenarios to explore would become even larger if they changed and (2) there are typically many requirements to test simultaneously. In this paper, we present MORLOT (Many-Objective Rein-forcement Learning for Online Testing), a novel online testing approach to address these challenges by combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and many-objective search. MORLOT leverages RL to incrementally generate sequences of environmental changes while relying on many-objective search to determine the changes so that they are more likely to achieve any of the uncovered objectives. We empirically evaluate MORLOT using CARLA, a high-fidelity simulator widely used for autonomous driving research, integrated with Transfuser, a DNN-enabled ADS for end-to-end driving. The evaluation results show that MORLOT is significantly more effective and efficient than alternatives with a large effect size. In other words, MORLOT is a good option to test DES with dynamically changing environments while accounting for multiple safety requirements."

To the best of our knowledge, RANUM is the first approach that confirms potential-defect feasibility with failure-exhibiting tests and suggests fixes automatically. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks of 63 real-world DNN architectures show that RANUM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across the three reliability assurance tasks. In addition, when the RANUM-generated fixes are compared with developers' fixes on open-source projects, in 37 out of 40 cases, RANUM-generated fixes are equivalent to or even better than human fixes."

Yet it remains unclear what issues developers encounter during the development, which challenges cause the issues, and what solutions developers receive.

By manually analyzing 586 highly relevant posts spanning 14 years, we observed a large variety (11 categories) of issues, dominated by those with interfacing and data handling among different languages. Behind these issues, we found that a major challenge developers faced is the diversity and complexity in multilingual code building and interoperability. Another key challenge lies in developers' lack of particular technical background on the diverse features of various languages (e.g., threading and memory management mechanisms). Meanwhile, Stack Overflow itself served as a key source of solutions to these challenges-the majority (73%) of the posts received accepted answers eventually, and most in a week (36.5% within 24 hours and 25% in the next 6 days). Based on our findings on these issues, challenges, and solutions, we provide actionable insights and suggestions for both multi-language software researchers and developers."

Given the abundance of relevant posts, navigating them and comparing different solutions is tedious and time-consuming. Recent work has proposed to automatically summarize SO posts to concise text to facilitate the navigation of SO posts. However, these techniques rely only on information retrieval methods or heuristics for text summarization, which is insufficient to handle the ambiguity and sophistication of natural language. This paper presents a deep learning based framework called Assortfor SO post summarization. Assortincludes two complementary learning methods, $\\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$, to address the lack of labeled training data for SO post summarization. $\\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ is designed to directly train a novel ensemble learning model with BERT embeddings and domain-specific features to account for the unique characteristics of SO posts. By contrast, $\\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ is designed to reuse pre-trained models while addressing the domain shift challenge when no training data is present (i.e., zero-shot learning). Both $\\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ outperform six existing techniques by at least 13% and 7% respectively in terms of the F1 score. Furthermore, a human study shows that participants significantly preferred summaries generated by $\\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ over the best baseline, while the preference difference between $\\mathbf{Assort}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{Assort}_{IS}$ was small."

The studies were performed with 20 subjects working on realistic software change tasks from widely-used open-source projects.

    "abstract": "Key classes are excellent starting points for developers, especially newcomers, to comprehend an unknown software system. Though many unsupervised key class identification approaches have been proposed in the literature by representing software as class dependency networks (aka software networks) and using some network metrics (e.g., h-index, a-index, and coreness), they are never aware of the field where the nodes exist and the effect of the field on the importance of the nodes in it. According to the classic field theory in physics, every material particle is in a field through which they exert an impact on other particles in the field via non-contact interactions (e.g., electromagnetic force, gravity, and nuclear force). Similarly, every node in a software network might also exist in a field, which might affect the importance of class nodes in it. In this paper, we propose an approach, iFit, to identify key classes in object-oriented software systems. First, we represent software as a CSNWD (Weighted Directed Class-level Software Network) to capture the topological structure of software, including classes, their couplings, and the direction and strength of couplings. Second, we assume that the nodes in the CSNWD exist in a gravitation-like field and propose a new metric, CG (Cumulative Gravitation-like importance), to measure the importance of classes. CG is inspired by Newton's gravitational formula and uses the PageRank value computed by a biased-PageRank algorithm as the masses of classes. Finally, classes in the system are sorted in descending order according to their CG values, and a cutoff is utilized, that is, the top-ranked classes are recommended as key classes. The experiments were performed on a data set composed of six open-source Java systems from the literature. The results show that iFit is superior to the baseline approaches on 93.75% of the total cases, and is scalable to large-scale software systems. Besides, we find that iFit is neutral to the weighting mechanisms used to assign the weights for different coupling types in the CSNWD, that is, when applying iFit to identify key classes, we can use any one of the weighting mechanisms."

We conducted a user study with this tool based on a dataset of TensorFlow comparable API methods spanning 198 hand-annotated facts from Stack Overflow posts. This study confirmed that providing comparable API methods can be useful for helping developers understand the design space of APIs: developers using our tool were significantly more aware of the comparable API methods and better understood the differences between them.

Medicine, too, has a long tradition of evidence-based practice, in which administering a treatment without evidence of its efficacy is considered malpractice. Similarly, in software engineering (SE) research, we can develop sound methodologies and mitigate threats to validity by basing study design decisions on evidence. Echoing a recent call for the empirical evaluation of design decisions in program comprehension experiments, we conducted a 2-phases study consisting of systematic literature searches, snowballing, and thematic synthesis. We found out (1) which validity threat categories are most often discussed in primary studies of code comprehension, and we collected evidence to build (2) the evidence profiles for the three most commonly reported threats to validity. We discovered that few mentions of validity threats in primary studies (31 of 409) included a reference to supporting evidence. For the three most commonly mentioned threats, namely the influence of programming experience, program length, and the selected comprehension measures, almost all cited studies (17 of 18) did not meet our criteria for evidence. We show that for many threats to validity that are currently assumed to be influential across all studies, their actual impact may depend on the design and context of each specific study. Researchers should discuss threats to validity within the context of their particular study and support their discussions with evidence. The present paper can be one resource for evidence, and we call for more meta-studies of this type to be conducted, which will then inform design decisions in primary studies. Further, although we have applied our methodology in the context of program comprehension, our approach can also be used in other SE research areas to enable evidence-based experiment design decisions and meaningful discussions of threats to validity."

By allowing developers to translate logical relatedness into spatial proximity, this code representation could aid in code navigation and comprehension. However, the association between developers' code comprehension and their visuo-spatial mental model of the code is not yet well understood. This mental model is affected on the one hand by the spatial code representation and on the other by the visuo-spatial working memory of developers. We address this knowledge gap by conducting an online experiment with 20 developers following a between-subject design. The control group used a conventional tab-based code visualization, while the experimental group used a code canvas to complete three code comprehension tasks. Furthermore, we measure the participants' visuo-spatial working memory using a Corsi Block test at the end of the tasks. Our results suggest that, overall, neither the spatial representation of code nor the visuo-spatial working memory of developers has a significant impact on comprehension performance.

By renaming as few as one identifier in the source code, the models would output completely irrelevant results, indicating that identifiers can be misleading for model prediction. However, identifiers are not completely detrimental to code comprehension, since the semantics of identifier names can be related to the program semantics. Well exploiting the two opposite impacts of identifiers is essential for enhancing the robustness and accuracy of neural code comprehension, and still remains under-explored. In this work, we propose to model the impact of identifiers from a novel causal perspective, and propose a counterfactual reasoning-based framework named CREAM. CREAM explicitly captures the misleading information of identifiers through multi-task learning in the training stage, and reduces the misleading impact by counterfactual inference in the inference stage. We evaluate CREAM on three popular neural code comprehension tasks, including function naming, defect detection and code classification. Experiment results show that CREAM not only significantly outperforms baselines in terms of robustness (e.g., +37.9% on the function naming task at F1 score), but also achieve improved results on the original datasets (e.g., +0.5% on the function naming task at F1 score)."

Existing non-intrusive methods are limited to extract either primitive human-computer interaction (HCI) actions or coarse-grained video fragments. In this work, we leverage Computer Vision (CV) techniques to build a programming screencast analysis tool which can automatically extract code-line editing steps (enter text, delete text, edit text and select text) from screencasts. Given a programming screencast, our approach outputs a sequence of coding steps and code snippets involved in each step, which we refer to as programming workflow. The proposed method is evaluated on 41 hours of tutorial videos and live coding screencasts with diverse programming environments. The results demonstrate our tool can extract code-line editing steps accurately and the extracted workflow steps can be intuitively understood by developers."

    "abstract": "Past studies have illustrated the prevalence of UI dark patterns, or user interfaces that can lead end-users toward (unknowingly) taking actions that they may not have intended. Such deceptive UI designs can be either intentional (to benefit an online service) or unintentional (through complicit design practices) and can result in adverse effects on end users, such as oversharing personal information or financial loss. While significant research progress has been made toward the development of dark pattern taxonomies across different software domains, developers and users currently lack guidance to help recognize, avoid, and navigate these often subtle design motifs. However, automated recognition of dark patterns is a challenging task, as the instantiation of a single type of pattern can take many forms, leading to significant variability. In this paper, we take the first step toward understanding the extent to which common UI dark patterns can be automatically recognized in modern software applications. To do this, we introduce AidUI, a novel automated approach that uses computer vision and natural language processing techniques to recognize a set of visual and textual cues in application screenshots that signify the presence of ten unique UI dark patterns, allowing for their detection, classification, and localization. To evaluate our approach, we have constructed ContextDP, the current largest dataset of fully-localized UI dark patterns that spans 175 mobile and 83 web UI screenshots containing 301 dark pattern instances. The results of our evaluation illustrate that AidUI achieves an overall precision of 0.66, recall of 0.67, F1-score of 0.65 in detecting dark pattern instances, reports few false positives, and is able to localize detected patterns with an IoU score of 0.84. Furthermore, a significant subset of our studied dark patterns can be detected quite reliably (F1 score of over 0.82), and future research directions may allow for improved detection of additional patterns. This work demonstrates the plausibility of developing tools to aid developers in recognizing and appropriately rectifying deceptive UI patterns."

    "abstract": "Modern web applications make extensive use of API calls to update the UI state in response to user events or server-side changes. For such applications, API-level testing can play an important role, in-between unit-level testing and UI-level (or end-to-end) testing. Existing API testing tools require API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI), which often may not be available or, when available, be inconsistent with the API implementation, thus limiting the applicability of automated API testing to web applications. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages UI testing to enable API-level testing for web applications. Our technique navigates the web application under test and automatically generates an API-level test suite, along with an OpenAPI specification that describes the application's server-side APIs (for REST-based web applications). A key element of our solution is a dynamic approach for inferring API endpoints with path parameters via UI navigation and directed API probing. We evaluated the technique for its accuracy in inferring API specifications and the effectiveness of the “carved” API tests. Our results on seven open-source web applications show that the technique achieves 98% precision and 56% recall in inferring endpoints. The carved API tests, when added to test suites generated by two automated REST API testing tools, increase statement coverage by 52% and 29% and branch coverage by 99% and 75%, on average. The main benefits of our technique are: (1) it enables API-level testing of web applications in cases where existing API testing tools are inapplicable and (2) it creates API-level test suites that cover server-side code efficiently while exercising APIs as they would be invoked from an application's web UI, and that can augment existing API test suites."

    "abstract": "Mobile apps are indispensable for people's daily life. With the increase of GUI functions, apps have become more complex and diverse. As the Android app is event-driven, Activity Transition Graph (ATG) becomes an important way of app abstract and graphical user interface (GUI) modeling. Although existing works provide static and dynamic analysis to build ATG for applications, the completeness of ATG obtained is poor due to the low coverage of these techniques. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach, ArchiDroid, to automatically augment the ATG via graph convolution network. It models both the semantics of activities and the graph structure of activity transitions to predict the transition between activities based on the seed ATG extracted by static analysis. The evaluation demonstrates that ArchiDroid can achieve 86% precision and 94% recall in predicting the transition between activities for augmenting ATG. We further apply the augmented ATG in two downstream tasks, i.e., guidance in automated GUI testing and assistance in app function design. Results show that the automated GUI testing tool integrated with ArchiDroid achieves 43% more activity coverage and detects 208% more bugs. Besides, ArchiDroid can predict the missing transition with 85% accuracy in real-world apps for assisting the app function design, and an interview case study further demonstrates its usefulness."

    "abstract": "Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or “pillars”-environmental, social, economic, technical and in-dividual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require refinement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identified. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from five article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratified (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly."

    "abstract": "Python programming language has gained enor-mous popularity in the past decades. While its flexibility signifi-cantly improves software development productivity, the dynamic typing feature challenges software maintenance and quality assurance. To facilitate programming and type error checking, the Python programming language has provided a type hint mechanism enabling developers to annotate type information for variables. However, this manual annotation process often requires plenty of resources and may introduce errors. In this paper, we propose a deep learning type inference technique, namely DLInfer, to automatically infer the type infor-mation for Python programs. DLInfer collects slice statements for variables through static analysis and then vectorizes them with the Unigram Language Model algorithm. Based on the vectorized slicing features, we designed a bi-directional gated recurrent unit model to learn the type propagation information for inference. To validate the effectiveness of DLInfer, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 700 open-source projects. We evaluate its accuracy in inferring three kinds of fundamental types, including built-in, library, and user-defined types. By training with a large-scale dataset, DLInfer achieves an average of 98.79% Top-1 accuracy for the variables that can get type information through static analysis and manual annotation. Further, DLInfer achieves 83.03% type inference accuracy on average for the variables that can only obtain the type information through dynamic analysis. The results indicate DLInfer is highly effective in inferring types. It is promising to apply it to assist in various software engineering tasks for Python programs."

    "abstract": "Automatic static analysis tools (ASATs) detect source code violations to static analysis rules and are usually used as a guard for source code quality. The adoption of ASATs, however, is often challenged because of several problems such as a large number of false alarms, invalid rule priorities, and inappropriate rule configurations. Research has shown that tracking the history of the violations is a promising way to solve the above problems because the facts of violation fixing may reflect the developers' subjective expectations on the violation detection results. Precisely identifying the revisions that induce or fix a violation is however challenging because of the imprecise matching of violations between code revisions and ignorance of merge commits in the maintenance history. In this paper, we propose ViolationTracker, an approach to precisely matching the violation instances between adjacent revisions and building the life cycle of violations with the identification of inducing, fixing, deleting, and reopening of each violation case. The approach employs code entity anchoring heuristics for violation matching and considers merge commits that used to be ignored in existing research. We evaluate ViolationTracker with a manually-validated dataset that consists of 500 violation instances and 158 threads of 30 violation cases with detailed evolution history from open-source projects. Violation Tracker achieves over 93 % precision and 98 % recall on violation matching, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach, and 99.4 % precision on rebuilding the histories of violation cases. We also show that ViolationTracker is useful to identify actionable violations. A preliminary empirical study reveals the possibility to prioritize static analysis rules according to further analysis on the actionable rates of the rules."

    "abstract": "To ensure compilers' quality, compiler testing has received more and more attention, and test-program generation is the core task. In recent years, some approaches have been proposed to explore test configurations for generating more effective test programs, but they either are restricted by historical bugs or suffer from the cost-effectiveness issue. Here, we propose a novel test-program generation approach (called MCS) to further improving the performance of compiler testing. MCS conducts memoized search via multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) for guiding the construction of effective test configurations based on the memoization for the explored test configurations during the on-the-fly compiler-testing process. During the process, the elaborate coordination among configuration options can be also well learned by multi-agent RL, which is required for generating bug-triggering test programs. Specifically, MCS considers the diversity among test configurations to efficiently explore the input space and the testing results under each explored configuration to learn which portions of space are more bug-triggering. Our extensive experiments on GCC and LLVM demonstrate the performance of MCS, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art test-program generation approaches in bug detection. Also, MCS detects 16 new bugs on the latest trunk revisions of GCC and LLVM, and all of them have been confirmed or fixed by developers. MCS has been deployed by a global IT company (i.e., Huawei) for testing their in-house compiler, and detects 10 new bugs (covering all the 5 bugs detected by the compared approaches), all of which have been confirmed."

    "abstract": "Database-backed applications are widely used. To effectively test these applications, one needs to design not only user inputs but also database states, which imposes unique challenges. First, valid database states have to satisfy complicated constraints determined by application semantics, and hence are difficult to synthesize. Second, the state space of a database is huge, as an application can contain tens to hundreds of tables with up to tens of fields per table. Making things worse, each test involving database operations takes significant time to run. Consequently, unhelpful database states and running tests on them can severely waste testing resources. We propose DBGRILLER, a tool that generates database states to facilitate thorough testing of database-backed applications. To effectively generate valid database states, DBGRILLER strategically injects minor mutation into existing database states and transforms part of the application-under-test into a stand-alone validity checker. To tackle the huge database state space and save testing time, DBGRILLER uses program analysis to identify a novel branch-projected DB view that can be used to filter out database states that are unlikely to increase the testing branch coverage. Our evaluation on 9 popular open-source database applications shows that DBGRILLER can effectively increase branch coverage of existing tests and expose previously unknown bugs."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172874",
    "abstract": "Database systems are widely used to store and query data. Test oracles have been proposed to find logic bugs in such systems, that is, bugs that cause the database system to compute an incorrect result. To realize a fully automated testing approach, such test oracles are paired with a test case generation technique; a test case refers to a database state and a query on which the test oracle can be applied. In this work, we propose the concept of Query Plan Guidance (QPG) for guiding automated testing towards “interesting” test cases. SQL and other query languages are declarative. Thus, to execute a query, the database system translates every operator in the source language to one of the potentially many so-called physical operators that can be executed; the tree of physical operators is referred to as the query plan. Our intuition is that by steering testing towards exploring a variety of unique query plans, we also explore more interesting behaviors-some of which are potentially incorrect. To this end, we propose a mutation technique that gradually applies promising mutations to the database state, causing the DBMS to create potentially unseen query plans for subsequent queries. We applied our method to three mature, widely-used, and extensively-tested database systems-SQLite, TiDB, and CockroachDB-and found 53 unique, previously unknown bugs. Our method exercises $4.85-408.48\\times$ more unique query plans than a naive random generation method and $7.46\\times$ more than a code coverage guidance method. Since most database systems-including commercial ones-expose query plans to the user, we consider QPG a generally applicable, black-box approach and believe that the core idea could also be applied in other contexts (e.g., to measure the quality of a test suite)."

    "abstract": "Database Management Systems (DBMSs) provide efficient data retrieval and manipulation for many applications through Structured Query Language (SQL). Incorrect implementations of DBMSs can result in logic bugs, which cause SELECT queries to fetch incorrect results, or UPDATE and DELETE queries to generate incorrect database states. Existing approaches mainly focus on detecting logic bugs in SELECT queries. However, logic bugs in UPDATE and DELETE queries have not been tackled. In this paper, we propose a novel and general approach, which we have termed Differential Query Execution (DQE), to detect logic bugs in SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE queries of DBMSs. The core idea of DQE is that different SQL queries with the same predicate usually access the same rows in a database. For example, a row updated by an UPDATE query with a predicate φ should also be fetched by a SELECT query with the same predicate φ, If not, a logic bug is revealed in the target DBMS. To evaluate the effectiveness and generality of DQE, we apply DQE on five production-level DBMSs, i.e., MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB, CockroachDB and SQLite. In total, we have detected 50 unique bugs in these DBMSs, 41 of which have been confirmed, and 11 have been fixed. We expect that the simplicity and generality of DQE can greatly improve the reliability of DBMSs."

    "abstract": "Modern software systems often exhibit numerous configuration options to tailor them to user requirements, including the system's performance behavior. Performance models derived via machine learning are an established approach for estimating and optimizing configuration-dependent software performance. Most existing approaches in this area rely on software performance measurements conducted with a single workload (i.e., input fed to a system). This single workload, however, is often not representative of a software system's real-world application scenarios. Understanding to what extent configuration and workload-individually and combined-cause a software system's performance to vary is key to understand whether performance models are generalizable across different configurations and workloads. Yet, so far, this aspect has not been systematically studied. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic empirical study across 25 258 configurations from nine real-world configurable software systems to investigate the effects of workload variation at system-level performance and for individual configuration options. We explore driving causes for workload-configuration interactions by enriching performance observations with option-specific code coverage information. Our results demonstrate that workloads can induce substantial performance variation and interact with configuration options, often in non-monotonous ways. This limits not only the generalizability of single-workload models, but also challenges assumptions for existing transfer-learning techniques. As a result, workloads should be considered when building performance prediction models to maintain and improve representativeness and reliability."

    "abstract": "Reducing energy consumption of software is an increasingly important objective, and there has been extensive research for data centers, smartphones, and embedded systems. However, when it comes to software, we lack working tools and methods to directly reduce energy consumption. For performance, we can resort to configuration options for tuning response time or throughput of a software system. For energy, it is still unclear whether the underlying assumption that runtime performance correlates with energy consumption holds, especially when it comes to optimization via configuration. To evaluate whether and to what extent this assumption is valid for configurable software systems, we conducted the largest empirical study of this kind to date. First, we searched the literature for reports on whether and why runtime performance correlates with energy consumption. We obtained a mixed, even contradicting picture from positive to negative correlation, and that configurability has not been considered yet as a factor for this variance. Second, we measured and analyzed both the runtime performance and energy consumption of 14 real-world software systems. We found that, in many cases, it depends on the software system's configuration whether runtime performance and energy consumption correlate and that, typically, only few configuration options influence the degree of correlation. A fine-grained analysis at the function level revealed that only few functions are relevant to obtain an accurate proxy for energy consumption and that, knowing them, allows one to infer individual transfer factors between runtime performance and energy consumption."

We propose to leverage recent advances in deep learning for text and code generation to assist developers in writing tests. We formalize the novel task of test completion to automatically complete the next statement in a test method based on the context of prior statements and the code under test. We develop TECo-a deep learning model using code semantics for test completion. The key insight underlying TECO is that predicting the next statement in a test method requires reasoning about code execution, which is hard to do with only syntax-level data that existing code completion models use. Teco extracts and uses six kinds of code semantics data, including the execution result of prior statements and the execution context of the test method. To provide a testbed for this new task, as well as to evaluate TECO, we collect a corpus of 130,934 test methods from 1,270 open-source Java projects. Our results show that Teco achieves an exact-match accuracy of 18, which is 29% higher than the best baseline using syntax-level data only. When measuring functional correctness of generated next statement, Teco can generate runnable code in 29% of the cases compared to 18% obtained by the best baseline.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning techniques have shown great success in automatic code generation. Inspired by the code reuse, some researchers propose copy-based approaches that can copy the content from similar code snippets to obtain better performance. Practically, human developers recognize the content in the similar code that is relevant to their needs, which can be viewed as a code sketch. The sketch is further edited to the desired code. However, existing copy-based approaches ignore the code sketches and tend to repeat the similar code without necessary modifications, which leads to generating wrong results. In this paper, we propose a sketch-based code generation approach named Skcoderto mimic developers' code reuse behavior. Given a natural language requirement, Skcoderretrieves a similar code snippet, extracts relevant parts as a code sketch, and edits the sketch into the desired code. Our motivations are that the extracted sketch provides a well-formed pattern for telling models “how to write”. The post-editing further adds requirement-specific details into the sketch and outputs the complete code. We conduct experiments on two public datasets and a new dataset collected by this work. We compare our approach to 20 baselines using 5 widely used metrics. Experimental results show that (1) Skcodercan generate more correct programs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art -CodeT5-base by 30.30%, 35.39%, and 29.62% on three datasets. (2) Our approach is effective to multiple code generation models and improves them by up to 120.1% in Pass@l. (3) We investigate three plausible code sketches and discuss the importance of sketches.

The release of GitHub Copilot constitutes a big step forward, also because of its unprecedented ability to automatically generate even entire functions from their natural language description. While the usefulness of Copilot is evident, it is still unclear to what extent it is robust. Specifically, we do not know the extent to which semantic-preserving changes in the natural language description provided to the model have an effect on the generated code function. In this paper we present an empirical study in which we aim at understanding whether different but semantically equivalent natural language descriptions result in the same recommended function. A negative answer would pose questions on the robustness of deep learning (DL)-based code generators since it would imply that developers using different wordings to describe the same code would obtain different recommendations. We asked Copilot to automatically generate 892 Java methods starting from their original Javadoc description. Then, we generated different semantically equivalent descriptions for each method both manually and automatically, and we analyzed the extent to which predictions generated by Copilot changed. Our results show that modifying the description results in different code recommendations in ∼46% of cases. Also, differences in the semantically equivalent descriptions might impact the correctness of the generated code (±28%)."

Also, code recommenders being “aware” of the developers' knowledge (e.g., what are the framework/libraries they already used in the past) and able to customize the recommendations based on this knowledge would be appreciated by practitioners.

    "abstract": "SMT solvers are often used in the back end of different software engineering tools─e.g., program verifiers, test generators, or program synthesizers. There are a plethora of algorithmic techniques for solving SMT queries. Among the available SMT solvers, each employs its own combination of algorithmic techniques that are optimized for different fragments of logics and problem types. The most efficient solver can change with small changes in the SMT query, which makes it nontrivial to decide which solver to use. Consequently, designers of software engineering tools often select a single solver, based on familiarity or convenience, and tailor their tool towards it. Choosing an SMT solver at design time misses the opportunity to optimize query solve times and, for tools where SMT solving is a bottleneck, the performance loss can be significant. In this work, we present Sibyl, an automated SMT selector based on graph neural networks (GNNs). Sibyl creates a graph representation of a given SMT query and uses GNNs to predict how each solver in a suite of SMT solvers would perform on said query. Sibyl learns to predict based on features of SMT queries that are specific to the population on which it is trained - avoiding the need for manual feature engineering. Once trained, Sibyl makes fast and accurate predictions which can substantially reduce the time needed to solve a set of SMT queries. We evaluate Sibyl in four scenarios in which SMT solvers are used: in competition, in a symbolic execution engine, in a bounded model checker, and in a program synthesis tool. We find that Sibyl improves upon the state of the art in nearly every case and provide evidence that it generalizes better than existing techniques. Further, we evaluate Sibyl's overhead and demonstrate that it has the potential to speedup a variety of different software engineering tools."

Recently, many approaches employing contrastive learning have shown promising results on code representation learning and greatly improved the performance of code search. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement in using contrastive learning for code search. In this paper, we propose CoCoSoDa to effectively utilize contrastive learning for code search via two key factors in contrastive learning: data augmentation and negative samples. Specifically, soft data augmentation is to dynamically masking or replacing some tokens with their types for input sequences to generate positive samples. Momentum mechanism is used to generate large and consistent representations of negative samples in a mini-batch through maintaining a queue and a momentum encoder. In addition, multimodal contrastive learning is used to pull together representations of code-query pairs and push apart the unpaired code snippets and queries. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale dataset with six programming languages. Experimental results show that: (1) CoCoSoDa outperforms 18 baselines and especially exceeds CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and UniXcoder by 13.3%, 10.5%, and 5.9% on average MRR scores, respectively.

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172878",
    "abstract": "To support high reliability and availability, modern cloud systems are designed to be resilient to node crashes and reboots. That is, a cloud system should gracefully recover from node crashes/reboots and continue to function. However, node crashes/reboots that occur under special timing can trigger crash recovery bugs that lie in incorrect crash recovery protocols and their implementations. To ensure that a cloud system is free from crash recovery bugs, some fault injection approaches have been proposed to test whether a cloud system can correctly recover from various crash scenarios. These approaches are not effective in exploring the huge crash scenario space without developers' knowledge. In this paper, we propose Crash Fuzz, a fault injection testing approach that can effectively test crash recovery behaviors and reveal crash recovery bugs in cloud systems. CrashFuzz mutates the combinations of possible node crashes and reboots according to runtime feedbacks, and prioritizes the combinations that are prone to increase code coverage and trigger crash recovery bugs for smart exploration. We have implemented CrashFuzz and evaluated it on three popular open-source cloud systems, i.e., ZooKeeper, HDFS and HBase. CrashFuzz has detected 4 unknown bugs and 1 known bug. Compared with other fault injection approaches, CrashFuzz can detect more crash recovery bugs and achieve higher code coverage."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172495",
    "abstract": "We present Diver, a novel technique for effectively finding critical bugs in SMT solvers. Ensuring the correctness of SMT solvers is becoming increasingly important as many applications use solvers as a foundational basis. In response, several approaches for testing SMT solvers, which are classified into differential testing and oracle-guided approaches, have been proposed until recently. However, they are still unsatisfactory in that (1) differential testing approaches cannot validate unique yet important features of solvers, and (2) oracle-guided approaches cannot generate diverse tests due to their reliance on limited mutation rules. Diver aims to complement these shortcomings, particularly focusing on finding bugs that are missed by existing approaches. To this end, we present a new testing technique that performs oracle-guided yet unrestricted random mutations. We have used Diver to validate the most recent versions of three popular SMT solvers: CVC5, Z3 and dReal. In total, Diver found 25 new bugs, of which 21 are critical and directly affect the reliability of the solvers. We also empirically prove DIVER's own strength by showing that existing tools are unlikely to find the bugs discovered by Diver."

Although many great models have been proposed, we do not yet have a good understanding of these models. This limits the further advancement of model robustness, debugging, and deployment for the vulnerability detection. In this paper, we surveyed and reproduced 9 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on 2 widely used vulnerability detection datasets: Devign and MSR. We investigated 6 research questions in three areas, namely model capabilities, training data, and model interpretation. We experimentally demonstrated the variability between different runs of a model and the low agreement among different models' outputs. We investigated models trained for specific types of vulnerabilities compared to a model that is trained on all the vulnerabilities at once. We explored the types of programs DL may consider “hard” to handle. We investigated the relations of training data sizes and training data composition with model performance. Finally, we studied model interpretations and analyzed important features that the models used to make predictions. We believe that our findings can help better understand model results, provide guidance on preparing training data, and improve the robustness of the models.

A recent study showed that despite successes, the existing ML/DL-based vulnerability detection (VD) models are limited in the ability to distinguish between the two classes of vulnerability and benign code. We propose DeepVD, a graph-based neural network VD model that emphasizes on class-separation features between vulnerability and benign code. DeepVDleverages three types of class-separation features at different levels of abstraction: statement types (similar to Part-of-Speech tagging), Post-Dominator Tree (covering regular flows of execution), and Exception Flow Graph (covering the exception and error-handling flows). We conducted several experiments to evaluate DeepVD in a real-world vulnerability dataset of 303 projects with 13,130 vulnerable methods. Our results show that DeepVD relatively improves over the state-of-the-art ML/DL-based VD approaches 13%–29.6% in precision, 15.6%–28.9% in recall, and 16.4%–25.8% in F-score. Our ablation study confirms that our designed features and components help DeepVDachieve high class-separability for vulnerability and benign code."

    "abstract": "Software vulnerabilities have posed huge threats to the cyberspace security, and there is an increasing demand for automated vulnerability detection (VD). In recent years, deep learning-based (DL-based) vulnerability detection systems have been proposed for the purpose of automatic feature extraction from source code. Although these methods can achieve ideal performance on synthetic datasets, the accuracy drops a lot when detecting real-world vulnerability datasets. Moreover, these approaches limit their scopes within a single function, being not able to leverage the information between functions. In this paper, we attempt to extract the function's abstract behaviors, figure out the relationships between functions, and use this global information to assist DL-based VD to achieve higher performance. To this end, we build a Behavior Graph Model and use it to design a novel framework, namely VulBG. To examine the ability of our constructed Behavior Graph Model, we choose several existing DL-based VD models (e.g., TextCNN, ASTGRU, CodeBERT, Devign, and VulCNN) as our baseline models and conduct evaluations on two real-world datasets: the balanced $\\text{FFMpeg}+\\text{Qemu}$ dataset and the unbalanced $\\text{Chrome} +\\text{Debian}$ dataset.

    "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) in automated software vulnerability detection. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in learning the graph representations of source code and are commonly adopted by existing DL-based vulnerability detection methods. However, the existing methods are still limited by the fact that GNNs are essentially difficult to handle the connections between long-distance nodes in a code structure graph. Besides, they do not well exploit the multiple types of edges in a code structure graph (such as edges representing data flow and control flow). Consequently, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, the existing GNN-based methods tend to fail to capture global information (i.e., long-range dependencies among nodes) of code graphs. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel vulnerability detection framework with grAph siMplification and enhanced graph rePresentation LEarning, named AMPLE. AMPLE mainly contains two parts: 1) graph simplification, which aims at reducing the distances between nodes by shrinking the node sizes of code structure graphs; 2) enhanced graph representation learning, which involves one edge-aware graph convolutional network module for fusing heterogeneous edge information into node representations and one kernel-scaled representation module for well capturing the relations between distant graph nodes. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show that AMPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 0.39%-35.32% and 7.64%-199.81% with respect to the accuracy and F1 score metrics, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPLE in learning global information of code graphs for vulnerability detection."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in Deep Learning (DL) has sparked interest in using DL to detect software vulnerabilities automatically and it has been demonstrated promising results at detecting vulnerabilities. However, one prominent and practical issue for vulnerability detection is data imbalance. Prior study observed that the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL-based vulnerability detection (DLVD) approaches drops precipitously in real world imbalanced data and a 73% drop of F1-score on average across studied approaches. Such a significant performance drop can disable the practical usage of any DLVD approaches. Data sampling is effective in alleviating data imbalance for machine learning models and has been demonstrated in various software engineering tasks. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a systematical and extensive study to assess the impact of data sampling for data imbalance problem in DLVD from two aspects: i) the effectiveness of DLVD, and ii) the ability of DLVD to reason correctly (making a decision based on real vulnerable statements). We found that in general, oversampling outperforms undersampling, and sampling on raw data outperforms sampling on latent space, typically random oversampling on raw data performs the best among all studied ones (including advanced one SMOTE and OSS). Surprisingly, OSS does not help alleviate the data imbalance issue in DLVD. If the recall is pursued, random undersampling is the best choice. Random oversampling on raw data also improves the ability of DLVD approaches for learning real vulnerable patterns. However, for a significant portion of cases (at least 33% in our datasets), DVLD approach cannot reason their prediction based on real vulnerable statements. We provide actionable suggestions and a roadmap to practitioners and researchers."

    "abstract": "In cloud systems, incidents are potential threats to customer satisfaction and business revenue. When customers are affected by incidents, they often request customer support service (CSS) from the cloud provider by submitting a support ticket. Many tickets could be duplicate as they are reported in a distributed and uncoordinated manner. Thus, aggregating such duplicate tickets is essential for efficient ticket management. Previous studies mainly rely on tickets' textual similarity to detect duplication; however, duplicate tickets in a cloud system could carry semantically different descriptions due to the complex service dependency of the cloud system. To tackle this problem, we propose iPACK, an incident-aware method for aggregating duplicate tickets by fusing the failure information between the customer side (i.e., tickets) and the cloud side (i.e., incidents). We extensively evaluate iPACK on three datasets collected from the production environment of a large-scale cloud platform, Azure. The experimental results show that iPACK can precisely and comprehensively aggregate duplicate tickets, achieving an F1 score of 0.871~0.935 and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 12.4%~31.2%."

    "abstract": "Many automated test generation techniques have been developed to aid developers with writing tests. To facilitate full automation, most existing techniques aim to either increase coverage, or generate exploratory inputs. However, existing test generation techniques largely fall short of achieving more semantic objectives, such as generating tests to reproduce a given bug report. Reproducing bugs is nonetheless important, as our empirical study shows that the number of tests added in open source repositories due to issues was about 28% of the corresponding project test suite size. Meanwhile, due to the difficulties of transforming the expected program semantics in bug reports into test oracles, existing failure reproduction techniques tend to deal exclusively with program crashes, a small subset of all bug reports. To automate test generation from general bug reports, we propose Libro, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been shown to be capable of performing code-related tasks. Since LLMs themselves cannot execute the target buggy code, we focus on post-processing steps that help us discern when LLMs are effective, and rank the produced tests according to their validity. Our evaluation of Libro shows that, on the widely studied Defects4J benchmark, Libro can generate failure reproducing test cases for 33% of all studied cases (251 out of 750), while suggesting a bug reproducing test in first place for 149 bugs. To mitigate data contamination (i.e., the possibility of the LLM simply remembering the test code either partially or in whole), we also evaluate Libro against 31 bug reports submitted after the collection of the LLM training data terminated: Libro produces bug reproducing tests for 32% of the studied bug reports. Overall, our results show Libro has the potential to significantly enhance developer efficiency by automatically generating tests from bug reports."

First, we study five state-of-the-art Java defect datasets. Despite the multiple strategies applied by dataset maintainers to ensure reproducibility, all datasets are prone to breakages. Second, we conduct a case study in which we systematically test the reproducibility of 1,795 software artifacts during a 13-month period. We find that 62.6% of the artifacts break at least once, and 15.3% artifacts break multiple times. We manually investigate the root causes of breakages and handcraft 10 patches, which are automatically applied to 1,055 distinct artifacts in 2,948 fixes. Based on the nature of the root causes, we propose automated dependency caching and artifact isolation to prevent further breakage. In particular, we show that isolating artifacts to eliminate external dependencies increases reproducibility to 95% or higher, which is on par with the level of reproducibility exhibited by the most reliable manually curated dataset."

    "abstract": "Bug reports are vital for software maintenance that allow the developers being informed of the problems encountered in the software. Before bug fixing, developers need to reproduce the bugs which is an extremely time-consuming and tedious task, and it is highly expected to automate this process. However, it is challenging to do so considering the imprecise or incomplete natural language described in reproducing steps, and the missing or ambiguous single source of information in GUI components. In this paper, we propose a context-aware bug reproduction approach ScopeDroid which automatically reproduces crashes from textual bug reports for mobile apps. It first constructs a state transition graph (STG) and extracts the contextual information of components. We then design a multi-modal neural matching network to derive the fuzzy matching matrix between all candidate GUI events and reproducing steps. With the STG and matching information, it plans the exploration path for reproducing the bug, and enriches the initial STG iteratively. We evaluate the approach on 102 bug reports from 69 popular Android apps, and it successfully reproduces 63.7% of the crashes, outper-forming the state-of-the-art baselines by 32.6% and 38.3%. We also evaluate the usefulness and robustness of ScopeDroid with promising results. Furthermore, to train the neural matching network, we develop a heuristic-based automated training data generation method, which can potentially motivate and facilitate other activities as user interface operations."

Automatically transferring code style to user's preference or consistency can facilitate project cooperation and maintenance, as well as maximize the value of open-source code.

In this paper, we present unsupervised methods to assist automatic code style transfer for arbitrary code styles. The main idea is to leverage Big Code database to learn style and content embedding separately to generate or retrieve a piece of code with the same functionality and the desired target style. We carefully encode style and content features, so that a style embedding can be learned from arbitrary code. We explored the capabilities of novel attention-based style generation models and meta-learning and implemented our ideas in DUETCS. We complement the learning-based approach with a retrieval mode, which uses the same embeddings to directly search for the desired piece of code in Big Code.

Recent program analyses build on the insight that source code can be modelled using techniques from natural language processing. Many of the regularities of source code that support this approach are due to the syntactic overhead imposed by textual programming languages. This syntactic overhead, however, is precisely what block-based languages remove in order to simplify programming. Consequently, it is unclear how well this modelling approach performs on block-based programming languages. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of language models for the popular block-based programming language Scratch. We model Scratch programs using n-gram models, the most essential type of language model, and transformers, a popular deep learning model. Evaluation on the example tasks of code completion and bug finding confirm that blocks inhibit predictability, but the use of language models is nevertheless feasible. Our findings serve as foundation for improving tooling and analyses for block-based languages."

However, they have been increasingly exploited to propagate toxic content, such as hate speech, malicious advertisement, and pornography, which can lead to highly negative impacts (e.g., harmful effects on teen mental health). Researchers and practitioners have been enthusiastically developing and extensively deploying textual content moderation software to address this problem. However, we find that malicious users can evade moderation by changing only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation software's performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2, 000 text messages collected from real users and summarize eleven metamorphic relations across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases, which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTTM achieves up to 83.9%, 51%, and 82.5% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Google, Baidu, and Huawei, respectively, and it obtains up to 91.2% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy. In addition, we leverage the test cases generated by MTTM to retrain the model we explored, which largely improves model robustness 0% ~ 5.9% EFR) while maintaining the accuracy on the original test set.

    "abstract": "Computer graphics are powered by graphics APIs (e.g., OpenGL, Direct3D) and their associated shader compilers, which render high-quality images by compiling and optimizing user-written high-level shader programs into GPU machine code. Graphics rendering is extensively used in production scenarios like virtual reality (VR), gaming, autonomous driving, and robotics. Despite the development by industrial manufacturers such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD, shader compilers - like traditional software - may produce ill-rendered outputs. In turn, these errors may result in negative results, from poor user experience in entertainment to accidents in driving assistance systems. This paper introduces FSHADER, a metamorphic testing (MT) framework designed specifically for shader compilers to uncover erroneous compilations and optimizations. FSHADER tests shader compilers by mutating input shader programs via four carefully-designed metamorphic relations (MRs). In particular, FSHADER fuses two shader programs via an MR and checks the visual consistency between the image rendered from the fused shader program with the output of fusing individually rendered images. Our study of 12 shader compilers covers five mainstream GPU vendors, including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, ARM, and Apple. We successfully uncover over 16K error-triggering inputs that generate incorrect rendering outputs. We manually locate and characterize buggy optimization places, and developers have confirmed representative bugs."

This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes, we find 13 bugs, nine of which have already been confirmed. MorphQ widens the slim portfolio of testing techniques of quantum computing platforms, helping to create a reliable software stack for this increasingly important field."

    "abstract": "Transformers have gained popularity in the software engineering (SE) literature. These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them. Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned to support the specific downstream task of interest (e.g., code summarization). While there is evidence suggesting the boost in performance provided by pre-training, little is known about the impact of the specific pre-training objective(s) used. Indeed, MLM is just one of the possible pre-training objectives and recent work from the natural language processing field suggest that pre-training objectives tailored for the specific downstream task of interest may substantially boost the model's performance. For example, in the case of code summarization, a tailored pre-training objective could be the identification of an appropriate name for a given method, considering the method name to generate as an extreme summary. In this study, we focus on the impact of pre-training objectives on the performance of trans-formers when automating code-related tasks. We start with a systematic literature review aimed at identifying the pre-training objectives used in SE. Then, we pre-train 32 transformers using both (i) generic pre-training objectives usually adopted in SE; and (ii) pre-training objectives tailored to specific code-related tasks subject of our experimentation, namely bug-fixing, code summarization, and code completion. We also compare the pre-trained models with non pre-trained ones and show the advantage brought by pre-training in different scenarios, in which more or less fine-tuning data are available. Our results show that: (i) pre-training helps in boosting performance only if the amount of fine-tuning data available is small; (ii) the MLM objective is usually sufficient to maximize the prediction performance of the model, even when comparing it with pre-training objectives specialized for the downstream task at hand."

Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets.

In few-shot learning, these models take as input a prompt, composed of natural language instructions, a few instances of task demonstration, and a query and generate an output. However, the creation of an effective prompt for code-related tasks in few-shot learning has received little attention. We present a technique for prompt creation that automatically retrieves code demonstrations similar to the developer task, based on embedding or frequency analysis. We apply our approach, Cedar, to two different programming languages, statically and dynamically typed, and two different tasks, namely, test assertion generation and program repair. For each task, we compare Cedar with state-of-the-art task-specific and fine-tuned models. The empirical results show that, with only a few relevant code demonstrations, our prompt creation technique is effective in both tasks with an accuracy of 76% and 52% for exact matches in test assertion generation and program repair tasks, respectively. For assertion generation, Cedar outperforms existing task-specific and fine-tuned models by 333% and 11%, respectively. For program repair, Cedar yields 189% better accuracy than task-specific models and is competitive with recent fine-tuned models. These findings have practical implications for practitioners, as Cedar could potentially be applied to multilingual and multitask settings without task or language-specific training with minimal examples and effort."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172757",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being adopted as components in software systems. Creating and specializing DNNs from scratch has grown increasingly difficult as state-of-the-art architectures grow more complex. Following the path of traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers have begun to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and fine-tune these models for downstream tasks. Prior works have studied reuse practices for traditional software packages to guide software engineers towards better package maintenance and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of knowledge to guide behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of PTM reuse. We interviewed 12 practitioners from the most popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face, to learn the practices and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model the decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified practices, we describe useful attributes for model reuse, including provenance, reproducibility, and portability. Three challenges for PTM reuse are missing attributes, discrepancies between claimed and actual performance, and model risks. We substantiate these identified challenges with systematic measurements in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs future directions on optimizing deep learning ecosystems by automated measuring useful attributes and potential attacks, and envision future research on infrastructure and standardization for model registries."

    "publication": "ICSE",
    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172726",
    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained models such as CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT have earned widespread attention from both academia and industry. Attributed to the superior ability in code representation, they have been further applied in multiple downstream tasks such as clone detection, code search and code translation. However, it is also observed that these state-of-the-art pre-trained models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. The performance of these pre-trained models drops significantly with simple perturbations such as renaming variable names. This weakness may be inherited by their downstream models and thereby amplified at an unprecedented scale. To this end, we propose an approach namely ContraBERT that aims to improve the robustness of pre-trained models via contrastive learning. Specifically, we design nine kinds of simple and complex data augmentation operators on the programming language (PL) and natural language (NL) data to construct different variants. Furthermore, we continue to train the existing pre-trained models by masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive pre-training task on the original samples with their augmented variants to enhance the robustness of the model. The extensive ex-periments demonstrate that ContraBERT can effectively improve the robustness of the existing pre-trained models. Further study also confirms that these robustness-enhanced models provide improvements as compared to original models over four popular downstream tasks."

    "abstract": "The IFDS framework supports interprocedural dataflow analysis with distributive flow functions over finite domains. A large class of interprocedural dataflow analysis problems can be formulated as IFDS problems and thus can be solved with the IFDS framework precisely. Unfortunately, scaling IFDS analysis to large-scale programs is challenging in terms of both massive memory consumption and low analysis efficiency. This paper presents DStream, a scalable system dedicated to precise and highly parallel IFDS analysis for large-scale programs. DStream leverages a streaming-based out-of-core computation model to reduce memory footprint significantly and adopts fine-grained data parallelism to achieve efficiency. We implemented a taint analysis as a DStream instance analysis and compared DStream with three state-of-the-art tools. Our exper-iments validate that DStream outperforms all other tools with average speedups from 4.37x to 14.46x on a commodity PC with limited available memory. Meanwhile, the experiments confirm that DStream successfully scales to large-scale programs which the state-of-the-art tools (e.g., FlowDroid and/or DiskDroid) fail to analyze."

    "abstract": "Code fragments from developer forums often migrate to applications due to the code reuse practice. Owing to the incomplete nature of such programs, analyzing them to early determine the presence of potential vulnerabilities is challenging. In this work, we introduce NeuralPDA, a neural network-based program dependence analysis tool for both complete and partial programs. Our tool efficiently incorporates intra-statement and inter-statement contextual features into statement representations, thereby modeling program dependence analysis as a statement-pair dependence decoding task. In the empirical evaluation, we report that NeuralPDA predicts the CFG and PDG edges in complete Java and C/C++ code with combined F-scores of 94.29% and 92.46%, respectively. The F-score values for partial Java and C/C++ code range from 94.29%-97.17% and 92.46%-96.01%, respectively. We also test the usefulness of the PDGs predicted by NeuralPDA (i.e., PDG*) on the downstream task of method-level vulnerability detection. We discover that the performance of the vulnerability detection tool utilizing PDG* is only 1.1% less than that utilizing the PDGs generated by a program analysis tool. We also report the detection of 14 real-world vulnerable code snippets from StackOverflow by a machine learning-based vulnerability detection tool that employs the PDGs predicted by NeuralPDA for these code snippets."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172616",
    "abstract": "Taint analysis, i.e., labeling data and propagating the labels through data flows, has been widely used for analyzing program information flows and ensuring system/data security. Due to its important applications, various taint analysis techniques have been proposed, including static and dynamic taint analysis. However, existing taint analysis techniques can be hardly applied to the rising microservice systems for industrial applications. To address such a problem, in this paper, we proposed the first practical non-intrusive dynamic taint analysis technique MirrorTaint for extensively supporting microservice systems on JVMs. In particular, by instrumenting the microservice systems, MirrorTaint constructs a set of data structures with their respective policies for labeling/propagating taints in its mirrored space. Such data structures are essentially non-intrusive, i.e., modifying no program meta-data or runtime system. Then, during program execution, MirrorTaint replicates the stack-based JVM instruction execution in its mirrored space on-the-fly for dynamic taint tracking. We have evaluated MirrorTaint against state-of-the-art dynamic and static taint analysis systems on various popular open-source microservice systems. The results demonstrate that MirrorTaint can achieve better compatibility, quite close precision and higher recall (97.9%/100.0%) than state-of-the-art Phosphor (100.0%/9.9%) and FlowDroid (100%/28.2%). Also, MirrorTaint incurs lower runtime overhead than Phosphor (although both are dynamic techniques). Moreover, we have performed a case study in Ant Group, a global billion-user FinTech company, to compare MirrorTaint and their mature developer-experience-based data checking system for automatically generated fund documents. The result shows that the developer experience can be incomplete, causing the data checking system to only cover 84.0% total data relations, while MirrorTaint can automatically find 99.0% relations with 100.0% precision. Lastly, we also applied MirrorTaint to successfully detect a recently wide-spread Log4j2 security vulnerability."

    "abstract": "Building new, powerful data-driven defenses against prevalent software vulnerabilities needs sizable, quality vulnerability datasets, so does large-scale benchmarking of existing defense solutions. Automatic data generation would promisingly meet the need, yet there is little work aimed to generate much-needed quality vulnerable samples. Meanwhile, existing similar and adaptable techniques suffer critical limitations for that purpose. In this paper, we present VULGEN, the first injection-based vulnerability-generation technique that is not limited to a particular class of vulnerabilities. VULGEN combines the strengths of deterministic (pattern-based) and probabilistic (deep-learning/DL-based) program transformation approaches while mutually overcoming respective weaknesses. This is achieved through close collaborations between pattern mining/application and DL-based injection localization, which separates the concerns with how and where to inject. By leveraging large, pretrained programming language modeling and only learning locations, VULGEN mitigates its own needs for quality vulnerability data (for training the localization model). Extensive evaluations show that VULGEN significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art (SOTA) pattern-based peer technique as well as both Transformer- and GNN-based approaches in terms of the percentages of generated samples that are vulnerable and those also exactly matching the ground truth (by 38.0-430.1% and 16.3-158.2%, respectively). The VULGEN-generated samples led to substantial performance improvements for two SOTA DL-based vulnerability detectors (by up to 31.8% higher in F1), close to those brought by the ground-truth real-world samples and much higher than those by the same numbers of existing synthetic samples."

    "abstract": "With the increasing disclosure of vulnerabilities in open-source software, software composition analysis (SCA) has been widely applied to reveal third-party libraries and the associated vulnerabilities in software projects. Beyond the revelation, SCA tools adopt various remediation strategies to fix vulnerabilities, the quality of which varies substantially. However, ineffective remediation could induce side effects, such as compi-lation failures, which impede acceptance by users. According to our studies, existing SCA tools could not correctly handle the concerns of users regarding the compatibility of remediated projects. To this end, we propose Compatible Remediation of Third-party libraries (CORAL) for Maven projects to fix vulnerabilities without breaking the projects. The evaluation proved that Coralnot only fixed 87.56% of vulnerabilities which outperformed other tools (best 75.32%) and achieved a 98.67% successful compilation rate and a 92.96% successful unit test rate. Furthermore, we found that 78.45% of vulnerabilities in popular Maven projects could be fixed without breaking the compilation, and the rest of the vulnerabilities (21.55%) could either be fixed by upgrades that break the compilations or even be impossible to fix by upgrading."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172607",
    "abstract": "Mass assignment is one of the most prominent vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs that originates from a misconfiguration in common web frameworks. This allows attackers to exploit naming convention and automatic binding to craft malicious requests that (massively) override data supposed to be read-only. In this paper, we adopt a black-box testing perspective to automatically detect mass assignment vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs. Indeed, execution scenarios are generated purely based on the OpenAPI specification, that lists the available operations and their message format. Clustering is used to group similar operations and reveal read-only fields, the latter are candidates for mass assignment. Then, test interaction sequences are automatically generated by instantiating abstract testing templates, with the aim of trying to use the found read-only fields to carry out a mass assignment attack. Test interactions are run, and their execution is assessed by a specific oracle, in order to reveal whether the vulnerability could be successfully exploited. The proposed novel approach has been implemented and evaluated on a set of case studies written in different programming languages. The evaluation highlights that the approach is quite effective in detecting seeded vulnerabilities, with a remarkably high accuracy."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172826",
    "abstract": "It is common practice for OSS users to leverage and monitor security advisories to discover newly disclosed OSS vulnerabilities and their corresponding patches for vulnerability remediation. It is common for vulnerability fixes to be publicly available one week earlier than their disclosure. This gap in time provides an opportunity for attackers to exploit the vulnerability. Hence, OSS users need to sense the fix as early as possible so that the vulnerability can be remediated before it is exploited. However, it is common for OSS to adopt a vulnerability disclosure policy which causes the majority of vulnerabilities to be fixed silently, meaning the commit with the fix does not indicate any vulnerability information. In this case even if a fix is identified, it is hard for OSS users to understand the vulnerability and evaluate its potential impact. To improve early sensing of vulnerabilities, the identification of silent fixes and their corresponding explanations (e.g., the corresponding common weakness enumeration (CWE) and exploitability rating) are equally important. However, it is challenging to identify silent fixes and provide explanations due to the limited and diverse data. To tackle this challenge, we propose CoLeFunDa: a framework consisting of a Contrastive Learner and FunDa, which is a novel approach for Function change Data augmentation. FunDa first increases the fix data (i.e., code changes) at the function level with unsupervised and supervised strategies. Then the contrastive learner leverages contrastive learning to effectively train a function change encoder, FCBERT, from diverse fix data. Finally, we leverage FCBERT to further fine-tune three downstream tasks, i.e., silent fix identification, CWE category classification, and exploitability rating classification, respectively. Our result shows that CoLeFunDa outperforms all the state-of-art baselines in all downstream tasks. We also conduct a survey to verify the effectiveness of CoLeFunDa in practical usage. The result shows that CoLeFunDa can categorize 62.5% (25 out of 40) CVEs with correct CWE categories within the top 2 recommendations."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172721",
    "abstract": "Industrial control systems (ICSs) are types of cyber-physical systems in which programs, written in languages such as ladder logic or structured text, control industrial processes through sensing and actuating. Given the use of ICSs in critical infrastructure, it is important to test their resilience against manipulations of sensor/actuator inputs. Unfortunately, existing methods fail to test them comprehensively, as they typically focus on finding the simplest-to-craft manipulations for a testing goal, and are also unable to determine when a test is simply a minor permutation of another, i.e. based on the same causal events. In this work, we propose a guided fuzzing approach for finding 'meaningfully different’ tests for an ICS via a general formalisation of sensor/actuator-manipulation strategies. Our algorithm identifies the causal events in a test, generalises them to an equivalence class, and then updates the fuzzing strategy so as to find new tests that are causally different from those already identified. An evaluation of our approach on a real-world water treatment system shows that it is able to find 106% more causally different tests than the most comparable fuzzer. While we focus on diversifying the test suite of an ICS, our formalisation may be useful for other fuzzers that intercept communication channels."

Virtual tests, where autonomous vehicles are tested in software simulation, are common practices because they are more efficient and safer compared to field operational tests. Specifically, search-based approaches are used to find particularly critical situations. These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate tests; however, system-atically producing bug-revealing tests for ADS remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce DoppelTest, a test generation approach for ADSes that utilizes a genetic algorithm to discover bug-revealing violations by generating scenarios with multiple autonomous vehicles that account for traffic control (e.g., traffic signals and stop signs). Our extensive evaluation shows that DoppelTest can efficiently discover 123 bug-revealing violations for a production-grade ADS (Baidu Apollo) which we then classify into 8 unique bug categories."

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems rely on a perception component to interpret their surroundings, and when misinterpretations occur, they can and have led to serious and fatal system-level failures. Yet, existing methods for testing perception software remain limited in both their capacity to efficiently generate test data that translates to real-world performance and in their diversity to capture the long tail of rare but safety-critical scenarios. These limitations are particularly evident for perception systems based on LiDAR sensors, which have emerged as a crucial component in modern autonomous systems due to their ability to provide a 3D scan of the world and operate in all lighting conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach for testing LiDAR-based perception systems by leveraging existing real-world data as a basis to generate realistic and diverse test cases through mutations that preserve realism invariants while generating inputs rarely found in existing data sets, and automatically crafting oracles that identify potentially safety-critical issues in perception performance. We implemented our approach to assess its ability to identify perception failures, generating over 50,000 test inputs for five state-of-the-art LiDAR-based perception systems. We found that it efficiently generated test cases that yield errors in perception that could result in real consequences if these systems were deployed and does so at a low rate of false positives."

From large technology companies to startups, companies are participating in the OSS ecosystem by open-sourcing their technology, sponsoring projects through funding or paid developer time. However, our understanding of the OSS ecosystem is rooted in the “old world” model where individual contributors sustain OSS projects. In this work, we create a more comprehensive understanding of the hybrid OSS landscape by investigating what motivates companies to contribute and how they contribute to OSS. We conducted interviews with 20 participants who have different roles (e.g., CEO, OSPO Lead, Ecosystem Strategist) at 17 different companies of different sizes from large companies (e.g. Microsoft, RedHat, Google, Spotify) to startups. Data from semi-structured interviews reveal that company motivations can be categorized into four levels (Founders' Vision, Reputation, Business Advantage, and Reciprocity) and companies participate through different mechanisms (e.g., Developers' Time, Mentoring Time, Advocacy & Promotion Time), each of which tie to the different types of motivations. We hope our findings nudge more companies to participate in the OSS ecosystem, helping make it robust, diverse, and sustainable."

Furthermore, existing SBOM-related studies tend to be ad-hoc and lack software engineering focuses. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first empirical study to interview and survey SBOM practitioners. We applied a mixed qualitative and quantitative method for gathering data from 17 interviewees and 65 survey respondents from 15 countries across five continents to understand how practitioners perceive the SBOM field. We summarized 26 statements and grouped them into three topics on SBOM's states of practice. Based on the study results, we derived a goal model and highlighted future directions where practitioners can put in their effort."
