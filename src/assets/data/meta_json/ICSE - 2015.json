    "abstract": "No matter what future we may envision, it relies on software that has not yet been written. Even now, software-intensive systems have woven themselves into the interstitial spaces of civilization, and we as individuals and as a species have slowly surrendered ourselves to computing. Looking back, we can identify several major and distinct styles whereby we have built such systems. We have come a long way, and even today, we certainly can name a number of best practices for software development that yield systems of quality. However, by no means can we stand still: the nature of the systems we build continues to change, and as they collectively weave themselves into our live, we must attend not only to the technical elements of software development, we must also attend to human needs. In this presentation we will look at the history of software engineering and offer some grand challenges for the future."

    "abstract": "Spreadsheets are used extensively in business processes around the world and as such, are a topic of research interest. Over the past few years, many spreadsheet studies have been performed on the EUSES spreadsheet corpus. While this corpus has served the spreadsheet community well, the spreadsheets it contains are mainly gathered with search engines and might therefore not represent spreadsheets used in companies. This paper presents an analysis of a new dataset, extracted from the Enron email archive, containing over 15,000 spreadsheets used within the Enron Corporation. In addition to the spreadsheets, we also present an analysis of the associated emails, where we look into spreadsheet-specific email behavior. Our analysis shows that 1) 24% of Enron spreadsheets with at least one formula contain an Excel error, 2) there is little diversity in the functions used in spreadsheets: 76% of spreadsheets in the presented corpus use the same 15 functions and, 3) the spreadsheets are substantially more smelly than the EUSES corpus, especially in terms of long calculation chains. Regarding the emails, we observe that spreadsheets 1) are a frequent topic of email conversation with 10% of emails either referring to or sending spreadsheets and 2) the emails are frequently discussing errors in and updates to spreadsheets."

    "abstract": "Big Data computing platform has evolved to be a multi-tenant service. The service quality matters because system failure or performance slowdown could adversely affect business and user experience. There is few study in literature on service quality issues of production Big Data computing platform. In this paper, we present an empirical study on the service quality issues of Microsoft ProductA, which is a company-wide multi-tenant Big Data computing platform, serving thousands of customers from hundreds of teams. ProductA has a well-defined incident management process, which helps customers report and mitigate service quality issues on 24/7 basis. This paper explores the common symptom, causes and mitigation of service quality issues in Big Data computing. We conduct an empirical study on 210 real service quality issues in ProductA. Our major findings include (1) 21.0% of escalations are caused by hardware faults; (2) 36.2% are caused by system side defects; (3) 37.2% are due to customer side faults. We also studied the general diagnosis process and the commonly adopted mitigation solutions. Our findings can help improve current development and maintenance practice of Big Data computing platform, and motivate tool support."

We find that we need to be more sophisticated with our guidelines for the code review workflow. We show how our findings from code reviewing practice influence our code review tools at Microsoft. Finally, we assert that, due to its costs, code reviewing practice is a topic deserving to be better understood, systematized and applied to software engineering workflow with more precision than the best practice currently prescribes."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202947",
    "abstract": "Most home appliance devices such as electric ovens are reactive systems which repeat receiving a user input/event through an event handler, updating their internal state based on the input, and generating outputs. A challenge to test a reactive program is to check if the program correctly reacts to various non-deterministic sequence of events because an unexpected sequence of events may make the system fail due to the race conditions between the main loop and asynchronous event handlers. Thus, it is important to systematically generate/test various sequences of events by controlling the order of events and relative timing of event occurrences with respect to the main loop execution. In this paper, we report our industrial experience to solve the aforementioned problem by developing a systematic event generation framework based on concolic testing technique. We have applied the framework to a LG electric oven and detected several critical bugs including one that makes the oven ignore user inputs due to the illegal state transition."

    "abstract": "Applying code changes to software systems and testing these code changes can be a complex task that involves many different types of software testing strategies, e.g. system and integration tests. However, not all test failures reported during code integration are hinting towards code defects. Testing large systems such as the Microsoft Windows operating system requires complex test infrastructures, which may lead to test failures caused by faulty tests and test infrastructure issues. Such false test alarms are particular annoying as they raise engineer attention and require manual inspection without providing any benefit. The goal of this work is to use empirical data to minimize the number of false test alarms reported during system and integration testing. To achieve this goal, we use association rule learning to identify patterns among failing test steps that are typically for false test alarms and can be used to automatically classify them. A successful classification of false test alarms is particularly valuable for product teams as manual test failure inspection is an expensive and time-consuming process that not only costs engineering time and money but also slows down product development. We evaluating our approach on system and integration tests executed during Windows 8.1 and Microsoft Dynamics AX development. Performing more than 10,000 classifications for each product, our model shows a mean precision between 0.85 and 0.90 predicting between 34% and 48% of all false test alarms."

If tests could be accurately classified as likely to pass or fail prior to the run, it could save significant time while maintaining the benefits of early bug detection. In this paper, we present a case study to build a classifier for regression tests based on industrial software, Microsoft Dynamics AX. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of this classification as well as which aspects of the software are the most important in predicting regression test failures."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202950",
    "abstract": "Software systems tend to suffer from architectural problems as they are being developed. While modern software development methodologies such as Agile and Dev-Ops suggest different ways of assuring code quality, very little attention is paid to maintaining high quality of the architecture of the evolving systems. By detecting and alerting about violations of the intended software architecture, one can often avoid code-level bad smells such as spaghetti code. Typically, if one wants to reason about the software architecture, the burden of first defining the intended architecture falls on the developer's shoulders. This includes definition of valid and invalid dependencies between software components. However, the developers are seldom familiar with the entire software system, which makes this task difficult, time consuming and error-prone. We propose and implement a solution for automatic detection of architectural violations in software artifacts. The solution, which utilizes a number of predefined and user-defined patterns, does not require prior knowledge of the system or its intended architecture. We propose to leverage this solution as part of the nightly build process used by development teams, thus achieving continuous automatic validation of the system's software architecture. As we show in multiple open-source and proprietary cases, a small set of predefined patterns can detect architectural violations as they are introduced over the course of development, and also capture deterioration in existing architectural problems. By evaluating the tool on relatively large open-source projects, we also validate its scalability and practical applicability to large software systems."

    "abstract": "Many techniques have been proposed to automatically recover software architectures from software implementations. A thorough comparison among the recovery techniques is needed to understand their effectiveness and applicability. This study improves on previous studies in two ways. First, we study the impact of leveraging more accurate symbol dependencies on the accuracy of architecture recovery techniques. Previous studies have not seriously considered how the quality of the input might affect the quality of the output for architecture recovery techniques. Second, we study a system (Chromium) that is substantially larger (9.7 million lines of code) than those included in previous studies. Obtaining the ground-truth architecture of Chromium involved two years of collaboration with its developers. As part of this work we developed a new sub module-based technique to recover preliminary versions of ground-truth architectures. The other systems that we study have been examined previously. In some cases, we have updated the ground-truth architectures to newer versions, and in other cases we have corrected newly discovered inconsistencies. Our evaluation of nine variants of six state-of-the-art architecture recovery techniques shows that symbol dependencies generally produce architectures with higher accuracies than include dependencies. Despite this improvement, the overall accuracy is low for all recovery techniques. The results suggest that (1) in addition to architecture recovery techniques, the accuracy of dependencies used as their inputs is another factor to consider for high recovery accuracy, and (2) more accurate recovery techniques are needed. Our results show that some of the studied architecture recovery techniques scale to the 10M lines-of-code range (the size of Chromium), whereas others do not."

A Social Proximity Framework (SPF) provides the basis for the creation of this new flavor of smart spaces. Two different versions of the SPF, based on different communication infrastructures, help explain the characteristics of the different components, and show how the SPF can benefit from emerging connection-less communication protocols.

    "abstract": "Defect prediction models presented in the literature lack generalization unless the original study can be replicated using new datasets and in different organizational settings. Practitioners can also benefit from replicating studies in their own environment by gaining insights and comparing their findings with those reported. In this work, we replicated an earlier study in order to investigate the merits of organizational metrics in building defect prediction models for large-scale enterprise software. We mined the organizational, code complexity, code churn and pre-release bug metrics of that large scale software and built defect prediction models for each metric set. In the original study, organizational metrics were found to achieve the highest performance. In our case, models based on organizational metrics performed better than models based on churn metrics but were outperformed by pre-release metric models. Further, we verified four individual organizational metrics as indicators for defects. We conclude that the performance of different metric sets in building defect prediction models depends on the project's characteristics and the targeted prediction level. Our replication of earlier research enabled assessing the validity and limitations of organizational metrics in a different context."

    "abstract": "Many defect prediction techniques are proposed to improve software reliability. Change classification predicts defects at the change level, where a change is the modifications to one file in a commit. In this paper, we conduct the first study of applying change classification in practice. We identify two issues in the prediction process, both of which contribute to the low prediction performance. First, the data are imbalanced -- there are much fewer buggy changes than clean changes. Second, the commonly used cross-validation approach is inappropriate for evaluating the performance of change classification. To address these challenges, we apply and adapt online change classification, resampling, and updatable classification techniques to improve the classification performance. We perform the improved change classification techniques on one proprietary and six open source projects. Our results show that these techniques improve the precision of change classification by 12.2-89.5% or 6.4 -- 34.8 percentage points (pp.) on the seven projects. In addition, we integrate change classification in the development process of the proprietary project. We have learned the following lessons: 1) new solutions are needed to convince developers to use and believe prediction results, and prediction results need to be actionable, 2) new and improved classification algorithms are needed to explain the prediction results, and insensible and unactionable explanations need to be filtered or refined, and 3) new techniques are needed to improve the relatively low precision."

    "abstract": "Modern software systems often make use of third-party components to speed-up development and reduce maintenance costs. In return, developers need to update to new releases of these dependencies to avoid, for example, security and compatibility risks. In practice, prioritizing these updates is difficult because the use of outdated dependencies is often opaque. In this paper we aim to make this concept more transparent by introducing metrics to quantify the use of recent versions of dependencies, i.e. The system's \"dependency freshness\". We propose and investigate a system-level metric based on an industry benchmark. We validate the usefulness of the metric using interviews, analyze the variance of the metric through time, and investigate the relationship between outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities. The results show that the measurements are considered useful, and that systems using outdated dependencies four times as likely to have security issues as opposed to systems that are up-to-date."

NASA's Data Access Toolkit allows NASA analysts to query a large database of telemetry data. Since the user is unfamiliar with the data and several data transformations can occur, it is impossible to determine whether the system behaves correctly or not in full scale production situations. Small scale testing was already conducted manually by other teams and unit testing was conducted on individual functions. However, there was still a need for full scale acceptance testing on a broad scale. We describe how we addressed this testing problem by applying the idea of metamorphic testing [1]. Specifically, we base it on equivalence of queries and by using the system itself for testing. The approach is implemented using a model-based testing approach in combination with a test data generation and test case outcome analysis strategy.

This allows automatic identification of patterns that are expensive and represent practical optimisation opportunities. To evaluate the practicality of this analysis with a real world large-scale object-oriented application we completed a case study with the developers of letterboxd.com - a social network website for movie goers.

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202960",
    "abstract": "A key goal of performance testing is the detection of performance degradations (i.e., regressions) compared to previous releases. Prior research has proposed the automation of such analysis through the mining of historical performance data (e.g., CPU and memory usage) from prior test runs. Nevertheless, such research has had limited adoption in practice. Working with a large industrial performance testing lab, we noted that a major hurdle in the adoption of prior work (including our own work) is the incorrect assumption that prior tests are always executed in the same environment (i.e., labs). All too often, tests are performed in heterogenous environments with each test being run in a possibly different lab with different hardware and software configurations. To make automated performance regression analysis techniques work in industry, we propose to model the global expected behaviour of a system as an ensemble (combination) of individual models, one for each successful previous test run (and hence configuration). The ensemble of models of prior test runs are used to flag performance deviations (e.g., CPU counters showing higher usage) in new tests. The deviations are then aggregated using simple voting or more advanced weighting to determine whether the counters really deviate from the expected behaviour or whether it was simply due to an environment-specific variation. Case studies on two open-source systems and a very large scale industrial application show that our weighting approach outperforms a state-of-the-art environment-agnostic approach. Feedback from practitioners who used our approach over a 4 year period (across several major versions) has been very positive."

    "abstract": "Our recent research has shown that, in large-scale software systems, defective files seldom exist alone. They are usually architecturally connected, and their architectural structures exhibit significant design flaws which propagate bugginess among files. We call these flawed structures the architecture roots, a type of technical debt that incurs high maintenance penalties. Removing the architecture roots of bugginess requires refactoring, but the benefits of refactoring have historically been difficult for architects to quantify or justify. In this paper, we present a case study of identifying and quantifying such architecture debts in a large-scale industrial software project. Our approach is to model and analyze software architecture as a set of design rule spaces (DRSpaces). Using data extracted from the project's development artifacts, we were able to identify the files implicated in architecture flaws and suggest refactorings based on removing these flaws. Then we built economic models of the before and (predicted) after states, which gave the organization confidence that doing the refactorings made business sense, in terms of a handsome return on investment."

    "abstract": "Security testing and reviewing efforts are a necessity for software projects, but are time-consuming and expensive to apply. Identifying vulnerable code supports decision-making during all phases of software development. An approach for identifying vulnerable code is to identify its attack surface, the sum of all paths for untrusted data into and out of a system. Identifying the code that lies on the attack surface requires expertise and significant manual effort. This paper proposes an automated technique to empirically approximate attack surfaces through the analysis of stack traces. We hypothesize that stack traces from user-initiated crashes have several desirable attributes for measuring attack surfaces. The goal of this research is to aid software engineers in prioritizing security efforts by approximating the attack surface of a system via stack trace analysis. In a trial on Windows 8, the attack surface approximation selected 48.4% of the binaries and contained 94.6% of known vulnerabilities. Compared with vulnerability prediction models (VPMs) run on the entire codebase, VPMs run on the attack surface approximation improved recall from .07 to .1 for binaries and from .02 to .05 for source files. Precision remained at .5 for binaries, while improving from .5 to .69 for source files."

    "abstract": "Past studies show that developers who navigate code in a structural manner complete tasks faster and more correctly than those whose behavior is more opportunistic. The goal of this work is to move professional developers towards more effective program comprehension and maintenance habits by providing an approach that fosters structural code navigation. To this end, we created a Visual Studio plugin called Prodet that integrates an always-on navigable visualization of the most contextually relevant portions of the call graph. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by deploying it in a six week field study with professional software developers. The study results show a statistically significant increase in developers' use of structural navigation after installing Prodet. The results also show that developers continuously used the filtered and navigable call graph over the three week period in which it was deployed in production. These results indicate the maturity and value of our approach to increase developers' effectiveness in a practical and professional environment."

    "abstract": "It is often reported that there is a large gap between software engineering research and practice, with little transfer from research to practice. While this is true in general, one transfer technique is increasingly breaking down this barrier: extensions to integrated development environments (IDEs). With the proliferation of app stores for IDEs and increasing transfer effort from researchers several research-based extensions have seen significant adoption. In this talk we'll discuss our experience transferring code search research, which currently is in the top 5% of Visual Studio extensions with over 13,000 downloads, as well as other research techniques transferred via extensions such as NCrunch, FindBugs, Code Recommenders, Mylyn, and Instasearch. We'll use the lessons learned from our transfer experience to provide case study evidence as to best practices for successful transfer, supplementing it with the quantitative evidence offered by app store and usage data across the broader set of extensions. The goal of this 30 minute talk is to provide researchers with a realistic view on which research techniques can be transferred to practice as well as concrete steps to execute such a transfer."

This development happens over time and is influenced by many factors, however its understanding by teachers is crucial in order to develop activities and materials to transform students from novice to expert software engineers. In this paper, we analyse the evolution of learning strategies of novice, first year students, to expert, final year students. We analyse reflections on software development processes from students in an introductory software development course, and compare them to those of final year students, in a distributed systems development course. Our study shows that computer science - specific strategies evolve as expected, with the majority of final year students including design before coding in their software development process, but that several areas still require scaffolding activities to assist in learning development."

This study explores the effects of the use of Holistic Personas (i.e. a persona enriched with personality traits) on students' performance in creating conceptual designs. Our results indicate that the students were able to identify the personality traits of personas and their ratings of the personalities match closely with the intended personalities. A majority of the participants stated that their designs were tailored to meet the needs of the given personas' personality traits. Results suggest that the Holistic Personas can help students to take into account personality traits in the conceptual design process. Further studies are warranted to assess the value of incorporating Holistic Personas in conceptual design training for imparting skills of producing in-depth design by taking personalities into account."

An analysis of the code understanding strategies employed by novice students as they perform software maintenance exercises is fundamental for the effective teaching of software maintenance. In this paper, we analyze the strategies employed by second year students in a maintenance exercise over a large codebase. We analyze student reflections on their code understanding, maintenance process and the use of tools. We show that students are generally capable of working with large codebases. Our study also finds that the majority of students follow a systematic approach to code understanding, but that their approach can be significantly improved through the use of tools and a better understanding of reverse engineering approaches."

Our unique instructional technique had students work in both same-site and cross-site teams to contrast the two modes of working. The course was a collaboration between Aalto University, Finland and University of Victoria, Canada. Fifteen Canadian and eight Finnish students worked on a single large project, divided into four teams, working on interdependent user stories as negotiated with the industrial product owner located in Finland. Half way through the course, we changed the teams so each student worked in both a local and a distributed team. We studied student learning using a mixed-method approach including 14 post-course interviews, pre-course and Sprint questionnaires, observations, meeting recordings, and repository data from git and Flow dock, the primary communication tool. Our results show no significant differences between working in distributed vs. Non-distributed teams, suggesting that Scrum helps alleviate many GSE problems. Our post-course interviews and survey data allows us to explain this effect, we found that students over time learned to better self-select tasks with less inter-team dependencies, to communicate more, and to work better in teams."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202980",
    "abstract": "One of the challenges in teaching a first programming course is that in the same course, the students must learn basic programming techniques and high level abstraction abilities, and the application of those techniques and concepts in problem solving and (engineering) design. To confront this challenge, in previous years, we have included a project-based learning phase at the end of our course to encourage the acquisition of high level design and creativity. To address some of the shortcomings of our previous editions, we have recently included a mastery phase to the course. While project-based learning is suitable for teaching high-level skills that require design and creativity and prepare the students for the study of software engineering, mastery-based learning is suitable for concrete skills such as basic programming tasks. Our particular innovation is to allow students into the project phase only if they have demonstrated a minimum predefined competency level in programming. The combination of the two approaches seems to address most of the requirements of a first programming course. We present our motivation for combining the two pedagogical techniques and our experience with the course."

Thus these courses include fairly intensive team projects, the intent being to ensure that not only do students develop an understanding of key software engineering concepts and practices, but also develop the skills needed to work effectively in large design and development teams. But there is a definite risk in collaborative learning in that there is a potential that individual learning gets lost in the focus on the team's success in completing the project (s). While the team's success is indeed the primary goal of an industrial SE team, ensuring individual learning is obviously an essential goal of SE courses. We have developed a novel approach that exploits the affordances of mobile and web technologies to help ensure that individual students in teams in SE courses develop a thorough understanding of the relevant concepts and practices while working on team projects, indeed, that the team contributes in an essential manner to the learning of each member of the team. We describe the learning theory underlying our approach, provide some details concerning the prototype implementation of a tool based on the approach, and describe how we are using it in an SE course in our program."

Many pure computer science graduates are strongly I-shaped, with a great deal of depth in software technology, but little understanding of the other disciplines involved in such areas as business, medicine, transportation, or Internets of Things. This leaves them poorly prepared to participate in the increasing numbers of projects involving multi-discipline system thinking, and in strong need of software skills. We have developed and evolved an MS-level software engineering curriculum that enables CS majors to become considerably more T-shaped than when they entered. It includes courses in software management and economics, human-computer interaction, embedded software systems, systems and software requirements, architecture, and V&V, and a two-semester, real-client team project course that gives students experience in applying these skills. We find via feedback on the students' internships and job experiences that they and their employers have high rates of success in job offers and job performance."

In pedagogy, transparency emerges as an important issue that proposes to raise student awareness about the educational processes. Using GBL as an educational strategy we managed to make the game, a software, transparent. That is we made the inner processes of the game known to the students. As such, besides learning by playing, students had access to the game design, through intentional modeling. We collected evidence that, by disclosure of the information about the design, students better performed on learning software engineering."

However, several problems occurred: For example, the students became absorbed in programming rather than design and analysis activities. Therefore, the curriculum changed from project subjects to contest-based learning. Business management, marketing, and accounting subjects were added to the new curriculum, and students made information technology (IT) business plans using their knowledge of software engineering and business management. The IT business plans were submitted to various contests held by public newspaper companies and the federation of economic organizations in Japan. As a result, in the 10 years of the contest-based learning implementation, 20 teams have received awards in various IT business plan contests. We investigated 10 persons who had experience submitting business plans. We confirmed that contest-based learning had clearer goals, such as to win the contest prize, compared to project-based learning. Further, the abilities to solve problems and to investigate increased more in comparison with lecture-style and project-style education."

To understand the effects of the course, we conducted an exit and an 8-month survey and measured software quality of the students' solutions. The analysis shows that the hands-on experience helped everyone learn and retain robotics well, but the students' knowledge gain in software engineering depended on their prior programming knowledge.

However, many employers have expressed concern that graduates lack teamwork skills and one of the most commonly occurring problems with GSE models are issues with project management. Team managers and educators often oversee a number of teams and the large corpus of data, in combination with agile models, make it difficult to efficiently assess factors such as team role distribution and emotional climate. Current methods and tools for monitoring software engineering (SE) teamwork in both industry and education settings typically focus on member contributions, reflection, or product outcomes, which are limited in terms of real-time feedback and accurate behavioural analysis. We have created a dashboard that extracts and communicates team role distribution and team emotion information in real-time. Our proof of concept provides a real-time analysis of teamwork discussions and visualises team member emotions, the roles they have adopted and overall team sentiment during the course of a collaborative problem-solving project. We demonstrate and discuss how such a tool could be useful for SE team management and training and the development of teamwork skills in SE university courses."

The Software Design Studio is both a lab for students engaged in conceiving, designing and developing software products as well as an approach for teaching software engineering in the lab which emphasizes practical hands-on work and experimentation. The feedback on the Software Design Studio -- from both staff and students -- has been outstanding. Although the programme is designed as a small, elite programme there is interest to see if the teaching methods can be transferred across to the much larger undergraduate programme in Computer Science.

    "abstract": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is widely used in the software industry and university introductory courses today. Following the structure of most textbooks, such courses frequently are organised starting with the concepts of imperative and structured programming and only later introducing OOP. An alternative approach is to begin directly with OOP following the Outside-In teaching method as proposed by Meyer. Empirical results for the effects of Outside-In teaching on students and lecturers are sparse, however. We describe the conceptual design and empirical evaluation of two OOP introductory courses from different universities based on Outside-In teaching. The evaluation results are compared to those from a third course serving as the control group, which was taught OOP the \"traditional\" way. We evaluate the initial motivation and knowledge of the participants and the learning outcomes. In addition, we analyse results of the end term exams and qualitatively analyse the results of interviews with the lecturers and tutors. Regarding the learning outcomes, the results show no significant differences between the Outside-In and the \"traditional\" teaching method. In general, students found it harder to solve and implement algorithmic problems than to understand object oriented (OO) concepts. Students taught OOP by the Outside-In method, however, were less afraid that they would not pass the exam at the end of term and understood the OO paradigm more quickly. Therefore, the Outside-In method is no silver bullet for teaching OOP regarding the learning outcomes but has positive effects on motivation and interest."

We sought to replicate this emotional design effect in the context of introductory object-oriented programming (OOP). In this preliminary study, a group of freshmen studied a text on objects which was illustrated using anthropomorphic graphics while a control group had access to abstract graphics. We found no significant difference in the groups' scores on a comprehension post-test, but the experimental group spent substantially less time on the task than the control group. Among those participants who had no prior programming experience, the materials inspired by emotional design were perceived as less intelligible and appealing and led to lower self-reported concentration levels. Although this result does not match the pattern of results from earlier studies, it shows that the choice of illustrations in learning materials matters and calls for more research that addresses the limitations of this preliminary study."

    "abstract": "Software architecture lies at the heart of system thinking skills for software. Teaching software architecture requires contending with the problem of how to make the learning realistic -- most systems which students can learn quickly are too simple for them to express architectural issues. We address here the ten years' history of teaching an undergraduate software architecture course, as a part of a bachelor's program in software engineering. Included are descriptions of what we perceive the realistic goals to be, of teaching software architecture at this level. We go on to analyze the successes and issues of various approaches we have taken over the years. We finish with recommendations for others who teach this same subject, either as a standalone undergraduate course or integrated into a software engineering course."

Many CS/SE faculty may omit communication instruction from their courses because they do not want to reduce technical content. We experimented in a software-engineering-intensive second-semester programming course with strategies for improving students' writing of black box test plans that included no instruction on writing the plans beyond the standard lecture on testing. The treatment version of the course used 1) a modified assignment that focused on the plan's readers, 2) a model plan students could consult online, and 3) a modified grading rubric that identified the readers' needs. Three external raters found that students in the treatment sections outperformed students in the control sections on writing for five of nine criteria on rubrics for evaluating the plans and on the raters' holistic impression of the students' technical and communication abilities from the perspectives of a manager and a tester."

    "abstract": "Sustainability has emerged as a broad concern for society. Many engineering disciplines have been grappling with challenges in how we sustain technical, social and ecological systems. In the software engineering community, for example, maintainability has been a concern for a long time. But too often, these issues are treated in isolation from one another. Misperceptions among practitioners and research communities persist, rooted in a lack of coherent understanding of sustainability, and how it relates to software systems research and practice. This article presents a cross-disciplinary initiative to create a common ground and a point of reference for the global community of research and practice in software and sustainability, to be used for effectively communicating key issues, goals, values and principles of sustainability design for software-intensive systems.The centrepiece of this effort is the Karlskrona Manifesto for Sustainability Design, a vehicle for a much needed conversation about sustainability within and beyond the software community, and an articulation of the fundamental principles underpinning design choices that affect sustainability. We describe the motivation for developing this manifesto, including some considerations of the genre of the manifesto as well as the dynamics of its creation. We illustrate the collaborative reflective writing process and present the current edition of the manifesto itself. We assess immediate implications and applications of the articulated principles, compare these to current practice, and suggest future steps."

It requires experts from different disciplines to ensure legal compliance, to foster the users' trust, to enhance the usability of the application and to finally realize the application. Multidisciplinary requirements have to be formulated, interwoven and implemented. We advocate the use of interdisciplinary design patterns that capture the design know-how of typical, recurring features in socially aware applications with particular concern for socio-technical requirements. The proposed patterns address interdisciplinary concerns in a tightly interwoven manner and are intended to facilitate the development of accepted and acceptable applications that in particular deal with sensitive user context information."

    "abstract": "Social Software Engineering (Social SE), that is SE aiming to promote positive social change, is a rapidly emerging area. Here, software and digital artefacts are seen as tools for social change, rather than end products or 'solutions'. Moreover, Social SE requires a sustained buy-in from a range of stakeholders and end-users working in partnership with multidisciplinary software development teams often at a distance. This context poses new challenges to software engineering: it requires both an agile approach for handling uncertainties in the software development process, and the application of participatory, creative design processes to bridge the knowledge asymmetries and the geographical distances in the partnership. This paper argues for the role of design thinking in Social SE and highlights its implications for software engineering in general. It does so by reporting on the contributions that design thinking -- and in particular physical design -- has brought to (1) the problem space definition, (2) user requirements capture and (3) system feature design of a renewable energy forecasting system developed in partnership with a remote Scottish Island community."

In this paper we examine the role of software engineering practice as an agent of change/impact for societal sustainability through the manifestation of value sensitive concerns. These concerns remain relatively neglected by software design processes except at early stages of user interface design. Here, we propose a conceptual model that can contribute to a translation of value sensitive design from its current focus in participatory design to one located in mainstream software engineering processes. Addressing this need will have an impact of societal sustainability and we outline some of the key research challenges for that journey."

Yet, existing programming language constructs are not well-aligned with concepts of the sustainability domain. This undermines what we term technical sustainability of the software due to (i) increased complexity in programming of such concerns and (ii) continuous code changes to keep up with changes in (environmental, social, legal and other) sustainability-related requirements. In this paper we present a proof-of-concept approach on how technical sustainability support for new and existing concerns can be provided through flexible language-level programming. We propose to incorporate sustainability-related behaviour into programs through micro-languages enabling such behaviour to be updated and/or redefined as and when required."

Despite their importance, specially in Open Source Software (OSS) projects, these rules are usually implicit or scattered in the project documentation/tools (e.g., Tracking-systems or forums), hampering the correct understanding of the development process. We propose to enable the explicit definition and enforcement of governance rules for OSS projects. We believe this brings several important benefits, including improvements in the transparency of the process, its traceability and the semi-automation of the governance itself. Our approach has been implemented on top of My Lyn, a project-management Eclipse plug-in supporting most popular tracking-systems."

Still, Internet-based technologies and related software architectures feature various enablers for civic action beyond base social networking. To that end, this paper discusses the vision and initial details of AppCivist, a platform that builds on cross-domain research among social scientists and computer scientists to revisit service-oriented architecture and relevant services to further social activism.

As we enter 2015, with continued concerns that mega-crises may become the new normal, we need to develop novel methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our management of disasters. Software engineering as a discipline has long had an impact on society beyond its role in the development of software systems. In fact, software engineers have been described as the developers of prototypes for future knowledge workers; tools such as Github and Stack Overflow have demonstrated applications beyond the domain of software engineering. In this paper, we take the potential influence of software engineering one-step further and propose using the software service engineering paradigm as a new approach to managing disasters. Specifically, we show how the underlying principles of service-oriented architectures (SOA) can be applied to the coordination of disaster response operations. We describe key challenges in coordinating disaster response and discuss how an SOA approach can address those challenges."

We argue that such emergent considerations can neither be framed as absolute rules about how to act in relation to fixed and measurable conditions. Nor can they be addressed by simply framing them as non-functional requirements to be satisficed. Instead, a continuous process is needed that accepts the 'messiness' of social life and social research, seeks to understand complexity (rather than seek clarity), demands collective (not just individual) responsibility and focuses on dialogue over solutions. The framework has been derived based on retrospective analysis of ethical considerations in four software engineering in society projects in three different domains."

    "abstract": "Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to an unprecedented development in almost all areas of human life. It forms the basis for what is called \"the cognitive revolution\" -- a fundamental change in the way we communicate, feel, think and learn based on an extension of individual information processing capacities by communication with other people through technology. This so-called \"extended cognition\" shapes human relations in a radically new way. It is accompanied by a decrease of shared attention and affective presence within closely related groups. This weakens the deepest and most important bonds, that used to shape human identity. Sustainability, both environmental and social (economic, technological, political and cultural) is one of the most important issues of our time. In connection with \"extended cognition\" we have identified a new, basic type of social sustainability that everyone takes for granted, and which we claim is in danger due to our changed ways of communication. We base our conclusion on a detailed analysis of the current state of the practice and observed trends. The contribution of our article consists of identifying cognitive sustainability and explaining its central role for all other aspects of sustainability, showing how it relates to the cognitive revolution, its opportunities and challenges. Complex social structures with different degrees of proximity have always functioned as mechanisms behind belongingness and identity. To create a long-term cognitive sustainability, we need to rethink and design new communication technologies that support differentiated and complex social relationships."

Code Aware is an ecosystem inspired by sensor networks, consisting of monitors and actuators, aimed at improving code quality and team productivity. Code ware's vision entails (a) the ability to probe software artifacts of any granularity and localization, from variables to classes or files to entire systems, (b) the ability to perform both static and dynamic analyses on these artifacts, and (c) the ability to describe targeted remediation actions, for example to notify interested developers, through automated actuators. We provide motivational examples for the use of Code Aware that leverage current CI solutions, sketch the architecture of its underlying ecosystem, and outline research challenges."

There is a thin red line between a productive development session, where a developer actually does something useful and productive, and a session where the developer essentially produces \"fried air\", pieces of code whose quality and usefulness are doubtful at best. We believe that well-thought mechanisms of gamification built on fine-grained interaction information mined from the IDE can crystallize and reward good coding behavior. We present our preliminary experience with the design and implementation of a micro-gamification layer built into an object-oriented IDE, which at the end of each development session not only helps the developer to understand what he actually produced, but also praises him in case the development session was productive. Building on this, we envision an environment where the IDE reflects on the deeds of the developers and by providing a historical view also helps to track and reward long-term growth in terms of development skills, not dissimilar from the mechanics of role-playing games."

However, due to the enormous advances in software engineering in the past 40 years, the question stands: Is this observation still true? In fact, was it ever true? The vision for our research is to settle the discussion about Brooks' estimation once and for all: How much do developers test? Does developers' estimation on how much they test match reality? How frequently do they execute their tests, and is there a relationship between test runtime and execution frequency? What are the typical reactions to failing tests? Do developers solve actual defects in the production code, or do they merely relax their test assertions? Emerging results from 40 software engineering students show that students overestimate their testing time threefold, and 50% of them test as little as 4% of their time, or less. Having proven the scalability of our infrastructure, we are now extending our case study with professional software engineers from open-source and industrial organizations."

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has had extraordinary success in solving a diverse set of problems, ranging from digitization of libraries and translation of the Internet, to scientific challenges such as classifying elements in the galaxy or determining the 3D shape of an enzyme. By leveraging the power of the masses, it is feasible to complete tasks in mere days and sometimes even hours, and to take on tasks that were previously impossible because of their sheer scale. Underlying the success of crowdsourcing is a common theme - the microtask. By breaking down the overall task at hand into microtasks providing short, self-contained pieces of work, work can be performed independently, quickly, and in parallel - enabling numerous and often untrained participants to chip in. This paper puts forth a research agenda, examining the question of whether the same kinds of successes that microtask crowdsourcing is having in revolutionizing other domains can be brought to software development. That is, we ask whether it is possible to push well beyond the open source paradigm, which still relies on traditional, coarse-grained tasks, to a model in which programming proceeds through microtasks performed by vast numbers of crowd developers."

Traditional self-adaptive systems research has focused on inputs of systems performance, resources, exception, and error recovery that drive systems' reaction to their environments. The intelligent ability ofthese self-adaptive systems is impoverished without knowledge ofa user's covert attention (thoughts, emotions, feelings). As a result, it is difficult to build effective systems that anticipate and react to users' needs as projected by covert behavior. This paperpresents the preliminary research results on capturing users'intention through neural input, and in reaction, commanding actions from software systems (e.g., load an application) based on human intention. Further, systems can self-adapt and refine their behaviors driven by such human covert behavior. The long-term research goal is to incorporate and synergize human neural input.Thus establishing software systems with a self-adaptive capability to \"feel\" and \"anticipate\" users intentions and put the human in the loop."

    "abstract": "Despite their proven benefits, useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable specifications are not widely available. This is primarily because writing useful, non-trivial specifications from scratch is too hard, time consuming, and requires expertise that is not broadly available. Furthermore, the lack of specifications for widely-used libraries and frameworks, caused by the high cost of writing specifications, tends to have a snowball effect. Core libraries lack specifications, which makes specifying applications that use them expensive. To contain the skyrocketing development and maintenance costs of high assurance systems, this self-perpetuating cycle must be broken. The labor cost of specifying programs can be significantly decreased via advances in specification inference and synthesis, and this has been attempted several times, but with limited success. We believe that practical specification inference and synthesis is an idea whose time has come. Fundamental breakthroughs in this area can be achieved by leveraging the collective intelligence available in software artifacts from millions of open source projects. Fine-grained access to such data sets has been unprecedented, but is now easily available. We identify research directions and report our preliminary results on advances in specification inference that can be had by using such data sets to infer specifications."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203022",
    "abstract": "Software engineering lacks underpinning scientific theories both for the software it produces and the processes by which it does so. We propose that an approach based on information theory can provide such a theory, or rather many theories. We envision that such a benefit will be realised primarily through research based on the quantification of information involved and a mathematical study of the limiting laws that arise. However, we also argue that less formal but more qualitative uses for information theory will be useful. The main argument in support of our vision is based on the fact that both a program and an engineering process to develop such a program are fundamentally processes that transform information. To illustrate our argument we focus on software testing and develop an initial theory in which a test suite is input/output adequate if it achieves the channel capacity of the program as measured by the mutual information between its inputs and its outputs. We outline a number of problems, metrics and concrete strategies for improving software engineering, based on information theoretical analyses. We find it likely that similar analyses and subsequent future research to detail them would be generally fruitful for software engineering."

    "abstract": "Modern IDEs contain sophisticated components for inferring missing types, correcting bad syntax and completing partial expressions in code, but they are limited to the context that is explicitly defined in a project's configuration. These tools are ill-suited for quick prototyping of incomplete code snippets, such as those found on the Web in Q&A forums or walk-through tutorials, since such code snippets often assume the availability of external dependencies and may even contain implicit references to an execution environment that provides data or compute services. We propose an architecture for smart programming playgrounds that can facilitate rapid prototyping of incomplete code snippets through a semi-automatic context resolution that involves identifying static dependencies, provisioning external resources on the cloud and injecting resource bindings to handles in the original code fragment. Such a system could be potentially useful in a range of different scenarios, from sharing code snippets on the Web to experimenting with new ideas during traditional software development."

A promising class of concurrency abstractions replaces explicit concurrency mechanisms with a single linguistic mechanism that combines state and control and uses asynchronous messages for communications, e.g. active objects or actors, but that doesn't remove the hurdle of understanding non-local control transfer. What if the programming model enabled programmers to simply do what they do best, that is, to describe a system in terms of its modular structure and write sequential code to implement the operations of those modules and handles details of concurrency? In a recently sponsored NSF project we are developing such a model that we call capsule-oriented programming and its realization in the Panini project. This model favors modularity over explicit concurrency, encourages concurrency correctness by construction, and exploits modular structure of programs to expose implicit concurrency."

While MOP showed promising results, all prior research has focused on checking a single version of software. We propose to extend MOP to support multiple software versions and thus be more relevant in the context of rapid software evolution. Our approach, called eMOP, is inspired by regression test selection -- a well studied, evolution-centered technique. The key idea in eMOP is to monitor only the parts of code that changed between versions. We illustrate eMOP by means of a running example, and show the results of preliminary experiments. eMOP opens up a new line of research on MOP -- it can significantly improve usability and performance when applied across multiple versions of software and is complementary to algorithmic MOP advances on a single version."

In this paper, we argue the opposite - we present a case for explicit elasticity, where software engineers are given the flexibility to explicitly engineer elasticity into their distributed applications. We present several scenarios where elasticity retrofitted to applications by DevOps is ineffective, present preliminary empirical evidence that explicit elasticity improves efficiency, and argue for elastic programming languages and frameworks to reduce programmer effort in engineering elastic distributed applications. We also present a bird's eye view of ongoing work on two explicitly elastic programming frameworks - Elastic Thrift (based on Apache Thrift) and Elastic Java, an extension of Java with support for explicit elasticity."

This paper aims to introduce a new line of research on extracting social norms from the rich data available in software repositories.

In Object-Oriented (OO) systems, this often results in packages that are hard to understand and maintain, as they group together heterogeneous classes with unrelated responsibilities. In such cases, state-of-the-art re-modularization tools solve the problem by proposing a new organization of the existing classes into packages. However, as indicated by recent empirical studies, such approaches require changing thousands of lines of code to implement the new recommended modularization. In this demo, we present the implementation of an Extract Package refactoring approach in ARIES (Automated Refactoring In EclipSe), a tool supporting refactoring operations in Eclipse. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches, ARIES automatically identifies and removes single low-cohesive packages from software systems, which represent localized design flaws in the package organization, with the aim to incrementally improve the overall quality of the software modularisation."

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art in securing mobile software systems are substantially intended to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in a single app, but fail to identify vulnerabilities that arise due to the interaction of multiple apps, such as collusion attacks and privilege escalation chaining, shown to be quite common in the apps on the market. This paper demonstrates COVERT, a novel approach and accompanying tool-suite that relies on a hybrid static analysis and lightweight formal analysis technique to enable compositional security assessment of complex software. Through static analysis of Android application packages, it extracts relevant security specifications in an analyzable formal specification language, and checks them as a whole for inter-app vulnerabilities. To our knowledge, COVERT is the first formally-precise analysis tool for automated compositional analysis of Android apps. Our study of hundreds of Android apps revealed dozens of inter-app vulnerabilities, many of which were previously unknown."

Often, these specifications are not explicitly written by developers. If we want to use them for analysis, we need to obtain them through other methods; for example, by mining them out of program behavior. Several tools exist to mine data invariants and temporal properties from program traces, but few examine the temporal relationships between data invariants. An example of this kind of relationship would be \"the return value of the method isFull? is false until the field size reaches the value capacity\". We propose a data-temporal property miner, Quarry, which mines Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) relations of arbitrary length and complexity between Daikon-style data invariants. We infer data invariants from systems using Daikon, recompose these data invariants into sequences, and mine temporal properties over these sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that this method may recover important system properties."

In addition, collecting test scripts for automated testing is expensive. We address limitations of existing tools for GUI-based testing of Android apps in a novel hybrid approach called T+.

However, addressing these constraints may result in poor design choices, known as antipatterns, which may degrade software quality and performance. Thus, the automatic detection of antipatterns is an important activity that eases the future maintenance and evolution tasks. Moreover, it helps developers to refactor their applications and thus, to improve their quality. While antipatterns are well-known in object-oriented applications, their study in mobile applications is still in their infancy.

In this paper, we bridge the gap analyzing to what extent conceptual information, extracted using textual analysis techniques, can be used to identify smells in source code. The proposed textual-based approach for detecting smells in source code, coined as TACO (Textual Analysis for Code smell detectiOn), has been instantiated for detecting the Long Method smell and has been evaluated on three Java open source projects. The results indicate that TACO is able to detect between 50% and 77% of the smell instances with a precision ranging between 63% and 67%. In addition, the results show that TACO identifies smells that are not identified by approaches based on solely structural information."

    "abstract": "Configurable software systems enable developers to configure at compile time a single variant of the system to tailor it towards specific environments and features. Although traditional static analysis tools can assist developers in software development and maintenance, they can only run on a concrete configuration of a configurable software system. Thus, it is necessary to derive many configurations so that the configuration-specific parts of the source code can be checked. To avoid this tedious and error-prone process, we propose an approach to automatically derive a set of configurations that cover as many combinations of configuration-specific blocks of code or source files as possible. We represent a C program with CPP directives (e.g., #ifdef) with a CPP control-flow graph (CPP-CFG) in which CPP expressions are condition nodes and #ifdef blocks are statement nodes. We then explore possible paths on CPP-CFG with dynamic symbolic execution and depth-first search algorithms, and correspondingly, producing possible combinations of concrete blocks of C code, on which an existing static analysis tool can run. Our preliminary evaluation on a benchmark of configuration-dependent bugs on Linux shows that our approach can detect more bugs than a state-of-the-art tool."

Currently, developers either manually identify and fix such performance problems, or they rely on compilers to optimize their code.

This paper presents an approach for automatically finding and fixing performance bugs in JavaScript programs. To focus our work on relevant problems, we study 37 real-world performance bug fixes from eleven popular JavaScript projects and identify several recurring fix patterns. Based on the results of the study, we present a static analysis that identifies occurrences of common fix patterns and a fix generation technique that proposes to transform a given program into a more efficient program. Applying the fix generation technique to three libraries with known performance bugs yields fixes that are equal or equivalent to those proposed by the developers, and that lead to speedups between 10% and 25%."

    "abstract": "Few static analyses support concurrent higher-order programs. Tools for detecting concurrency bugs such as deadlocks and race conditions are nonetheless invaluable to developers. Concurrency can be implemented using a variety of models, each supported by different synchronization primitives. Using this poster, we present an approach for analyzing concurrent higher-order programs in a precise manner through abstract interpretation. We instantiate the approach for two static analyses that are capable of detecting deadlocks and race conditions in programs that rely either on compare-and-swap (cas), or on conventional locks for synchronization. We observe few false positives and false negatives on a corpus of small concurrent programs, with better results for the lock-based analyses. We also observe that these programs lead to a smaller state space to be explored by the analyses. Our results show that the choice of synchronization primitives supported by an abstract interpreter has an important impact on the complexity of the static analyses performed with this abstract interpreter."

Establishing validity of these transformations is crucial to ensure that they preserve the original behaviour. PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation of Embedded Systems) encompassing data processing is used to model parallel behaviours. Being value based with inherent scope of capturing parallelism, PRES+ models depict such data dependencies more directly; accordingly, they are likely to be more convenient as the intermediate representations (IRs) of both the source and the transformed codes for translation validation than strictly sequential variable-based IRs like Finite State Machines with Data path (FSMDs) (which are essentially sequential control flow graphs (CFGs)). In this work, a path based equivalence checking method for PRES+ models is presented."

    "abstract": "Whereas \"responsive\" web applications already offered a more desktop-like experience, there is an increasing user demand for \"rich\" web applications (RIAs) that offer collaborative and even off-line functionality. Realizing these qualities requires distributing previously centralized application logic and state vertically from the server to a client tier (e.g., for desktop-like and off-line client functionality), and horizontally between instances of the same tier (e.g., for collaborative client functionality and for scaling of resource-starved services). Both bring about the essential complexity of distributing application assets and maintaining their consistency, along with the accidental complexity of reconciling a myriad of heterogenous tier-specific technology. Tierless programming languages enable developing web applications as a single artefact that is automatically split in tier-specific code - resulting in a development process akin to that of a desktop application. This relieves developers of distribution and consistency concerns, as well as the need to align different tier-specific technologies. However, programmers still have to adopt a new and perhaps esoteric language. We therefore advocate developing tierless programs in a general-purpose language instead. In this poster, we introduce our approach to tierless programming in JavaScript. We expand upon our previous work by identifying development challenges arising from this approach that could be resolved through tool support."

This work addresses the challenges of adaptation planning -the decision-making process for selecting an appropriate course of action- with a focus on the problem of provisioning automated mechanisms for assembling adaptation plans, as a means to enhance adaptive capabilities under uncertainty. To this purpose, adaptations are modeled in a hierarchical manner, defining primitive actions, guarded actions, and deliberate plans, which may guide the system towards a desired state."

    "abstract": "UML (Unified Modeling Language) has been used for years in diverse domains. Its notations usually come with a reasonably well-defined syntax, but its semantics is left under-specified and open to different interpretations. This freedom hampers the formal verification of produced specifications and calls for more rigor and precision. This work aims to bridge this gap and proposes a flexible and modular formalization approach based on temporal logic. We studied the different interpretations for some of its constructs, and our framework allows one to assemble the semantics of interest by composing the selected formalizations for the different pieces. However, the formalization per-se is not enough. The verification process, in general, becomes slow and impossible -as the model grows in size. To tackle the scalability problem, this work also proposes a bit-vector-based encoding of LTL formulae. The first results witness a significant increase in the size of analyzable models, not only for our formalization of UML models, but also for numerous other models that can be reduced to bounded satisfiability checking of LTL formulae."

Though selective mutation testing has been widely investigated in recent years, many people still doubt if it can suit well for large programs. Realizing that none of the existing work has systematically studied the scalability of selective mutation testing, I plan to work on the scalability of selective mutation testing through several studies."

Substantial factors influencing this process are, e.g., the constellation of the development team, the growth and complexity of the system, and the error-proneness of software entities. For this purpose we build an agent based simulation tool which predicts the future of a project under given circumstances, stored in parameters, which control the simulation process. We estimate these parameters with the help of software mining. Our work exposed the need for a more fine-grained model for the developer behavior. Due to this we create a learning model, which helps us to understand the contribution behavior of developers and, thereby, to determine simulation parameters close to reality. In this paper we present our agent based simulation model for software evolution and describe how methods from statistical learning and data mining serves us to estimate suitable simulation parameters."

    "abstract": "Despite a global recognition of the problem, and massive investment from researchers and practitioners, the evolution of complex software systems is still a major challenge for today's architects and developers. In the context of product lines, or highly configurable systems, variability in the implementation and design makes many of the pre-existing challenges even more difficult to tackle. Many approaches and tools have been designed, but developers still miss the tools and methods enabling safe evolution of complex, variable systems. In this paper, we present our research plans toward this goal: making the evolution of software product lines safer. We show, by use of two concrete examples of changes that occurred in Linux, that simple heuristics can be applied to facilitate change comprehension and avoid common mistakes, without relying on heavy tooling. Based on those observations, we present the steps we intend to take to build a framework to regroup and classify changes, run simple checks, and eventually increase the quality of code deliveries affecting the variability model, mapping and implementation of software product lines."

So far, we already evaluated the influence of the model structure and the characteristics of the test cases that fail. Results suggest that the former does not affect significantly the performance of techniques, however, the latter indeed represents a major impact. Therefore, a worthy information in this context might be an expert who knows the crucial parts of the software, thus we propose the first version of a prioritization technique that considers hints from the expert and the distance notion in order to prioritize test cases.

For instance, a developer's perceived difficulty might be used to determine the likelihood of a bug being introduced into the code or the quality of the code a developer is working with. In psychology, biometric measurements, such as electro-dermal activity or heart rate, have already been extensively used to assess a person's mental state and emotions, but only little research has been conducted to investigate how these sensors can be used in the context of software engineering. In our research we want to take advantage of the insights gained in these psychological studies and investigate whether such biometric sensors can be used to measure developers' perceived difficulty while working on a change task and support them in their work."

Commonly, SPLs emerge from sets of existing variants when their individual maintenance becomes infeasible. However, current approaches for SPL migration do not support design models, are partially automated, or do not reflect constraints from SPL domains. To tackle these limitations, the goal of this doctoral research plan is to propose an automated approach to the SPL migration process at the design level. This approach consists of three phases: detection, analysis and transformation. It uses as input the class diagrams and lists of features for each system variant, and relies on search-based algorithms to create a product line architecture that best captures the variability present in the variants. Our expected contribution is to support the adoption of SPL practices in companies that face the scenario of migrating variants to SPLs."

Rather than expect scientists to become software engineering (SE) experts or the SE community to learn all of the intricacies involved in scientific software development projects, we seek a middle ground. The Scientific Software Process Improvement Framework (SciSPIF) will allow scientists to self-drive their own SPI efforts while leveraging the collective experiences of their peers and linking their concerns to established SE best practices.

Numerous solutions have been proposed to solve different aspects related to smart spaces, but we still lack a concrete framework that provides solutions suitable for the whole development life-cycle. This work aims to fill the gap and proposes a framework that provides: (i) well-defined abstractions for designing smart spaces, (ii) a middleware infrastructure to implement them and plug physical objects, (iii) a semantic layer to support heterogeneous elements, and (iv) plugs to integrate external simulators and be able to always work on \"complete'' systems in the different phases of the development."

We develop an extension to Java Path Finder (JPF) called JPF-Android to verify Android applications outside of the Android platform. JPF is a powerful Java model checker and analysis engine that is very effective at detecting corner-case and hard-to-find errors using its fine-grained analysis capabilities. JPF-Android provides a simplified model of the Android application framework on which an Android application can run and it can generate input events or parse an input script containing sequences of input events to drive the execution of the application. JPF-Android traverses all execution paths of the application by simulating these input events and can detect common property violations such as deadlocks and runtime exceptions in Android applications. It also introduces user defined execution specifications called Checklists to verify the flow of application execution."

    "abstract": "Software development teams need guidance on choosing security practices so they can develop code securely. The academic and practitioner literature on software development security practices is large, and expanding. However, published empirical evidence for security practice use in software development is limited and fragmented, making choosing appropriate practices difficult. Measurement frameworks offer a tool for collecting and comparing software engineering data. The goal of this work is to aid software practitioners in evaluating security practice use in the development process by defining and validating a measurement framework for software development security practice use and outcomes. We define the Security Practices Evaluation Framework (SP-EF), a measurement framework for software development security practices. SP-EF supports evidence-based practice selection. To enable comparison of practices across publications and projects, we define an ontology of software development security practices. We evaluate the framework and ontology on historical data and industrial projects."

It puts less emphasis on up-front plans and strict control and relies more on informal collaboration, coordination, and learning. This briefing provides a characterization and definition of agile project management based on extensive studies of large-scale industrial projects. It explains the circumstances behind the change from traditional management with its focus on direct supervision and standardization of work processes, to the newer, agile focus on self-managing teams, including its opportunities and benefits, but also its complexity and challenges. The main focus of the briefing is the four principles of agile project management: minimum critical specification, autonomous teams, redundancy, and feedback and learning. The briefing is intended for researchers, practitioners and educators in software engineering, especially project managers. For researchers, an updated state of the art will be uncovered, and the presentation will be based on current best evidence. For practitioners, principles, processes, and key success factors will be outlined and a successful large-scale case study of agile project management will be presented.

The 2nd workshop will continue in the same interactive vein and include a keynote, paper presentations with ample time for discussions, and a group exercise. For true impact and relevance this cross-cutting area requires contribution from both RE and Testing, and from both researchers and practitioners. For that reason we welcome a range of paper contributions from short experience papers to full research papers that both clearly cover connections between the two fields."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203147",
    "abstract": "Software engineers and architects of complex software systems need to balance hard quality attribute requirements while at the same time manage risks and make decisions with a system-wide and long-lasting impact. To achieve these tasks efficiently, they need quantitative information about design-time and run-time system aspects through usable and quick tools. While there is body of work focusing on code quality and metrics, their applicability at the design and architecture level and at scale are inconsistent and not proven. We are interested in exploring whether architecture can assist with better contextualizing existing system and code quality and metrics approaches. Furthermore, we ask whether we need additional architecture-level metrics to make progress and whether something as complex and subtle as software architecture can be quantified. The goal of this workshop is to discuss progress, gather empirical evidence, and identify priorities for a research agenda on architecture and metrics in the software engineering field."

    "abstract": "This paper is a report on the 8th International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing at the 37th International Conference on Sofrware Engineering (ICSE). Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a form of Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) that optimizes testing through the use of computational search. SBST is used to generate test data, prioritize test cases, minimize test suites, reduce human oracle cost, verify software models, test service-orientated architectures, construct test suites for interaction testing, and validate real time properties. The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners from SBST and the wider software engineering community to share experience and provide directions for future research, and to encourage the use of search techniques to combine aspects of testing with other aspects of the software engineering lifecycle.Three full research papers, three short papers, and threeposition papers will be presented in the two-day workshop. Additionally, six development groups have pitted their test generation tools against a common set of programs and benchmarks, and will present their techniques and results. This report will give the background of the workshop and detail the provisional program."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203149",
    "abstract": "HPC software is developed and used in a wide variety of scientific domains including nuclear physics, computational chemistry, crash simulation, satellite data processing, fluid dynamics, climate modeling, bioinformatics, and vehicle development. The increase in the importance of this software motivates the need to identify and understand appropriate software engineering (SE) practices for HPC architectures. Because of the variety of the scientific domains addressed using HPC, existing SE tools and techniques developed for the business/IT community are often not efficient or effective. Appropriate SE solutions must account for the salient characteristics of the HPC, research oriented development environment. This situation creates a need for members of the SE community to interact with members of the scientific and HPC communities to address this need. This workshop facilitates that collaboration by bringing together members of the SE, the scientific, and the HPC communities to share perspectives and present findings relevant to research, practice, and education. A significant portion of the workshop is devoted to focused interaction among the participants with the goal of generating a research agenda to improve tools, techniques, and experimental methods regarding SE for HPC science."

    "paper": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203150",
    "abstract": "Spreadsheets are heavily used in industry, becausethey are easily written and adjusted, using an intuitive visual interface. They often start out as simple tools; however, over time spreadsheets can become increasingly complex, up to the point where they become complicated and inflexible. In many ways, spreadsheet are similar to software: both concern the storage and manipulation of data and the presentation of results to the user. Because of this similarity, many methods and techniques from software engineering can be applied to spreadsheets. The role of SEMS, the International Workshop on Software Engineering Methods in Spreadsheets is to explore the possibilities of applying successful methods from software engineering to spreadsheets. Some, like testing and visualization, have been tried before and can be built upon. For methods that have not yet been tried on spreadsheets, SEMS will serve as a platform for early feedback. The SEMS program included an industrial keynote, \"spreadsheet stories\" (success or failure), short and long research papers,a good mix of industrial and academic researchers, as well as lively discussion and debate."

    "abstract": "Differing perceptions and expectations are obstaclesto collaboration between software engineering (SE) researchersand practitioners: Researchers often have a view thatpractitioners are reluctant to share real data. Practitionersbelieve that researchers are mostly working on topics which aredivorced from real industrial needs. Researchers believe thatpractitioners are looking for quick fixes. Practitioners have aview that case studies in research do not represent thecomplexities of real projects. Researchers may expect a few yearsto do research on a problem whereas practitioners expect a quicksolution that pays off immediately.Researchers and practitioners need to identify the gaps and todiscover the ways to collaborate to strengthen SE research andindustrial practice (IP). The main purpose of this workshop is tobring together researchers and practitioners to discuss thecurrent state of SE research and IP and to enhance collaborationbetween them. The SER&IP 2015 workshop provided a platformto share success stories of SE research-practice partnerships aswell as to discuss the challenges, through a day-long agenda ofkeynotes, paper presentations and round table discussions."

The innovations sought for CPS demand them to deal effectively with dynamicity of their environment, to be scalable, adaptive, tolerant to threats, etc. -- i.e. they have to be smart. Although approaches in software engineering (SE) exist that individually meet these demands, their synergy to address the challenges of smart CPS (sCPS) in a holistic manner remains an open challenge. The workshop focuses on software engineering challenges for sCPS. The goals are to increase the understanding of problems of SE for sCPS, study foundational principles for engineering sCPS, and identify promising SE solutions for sCPS. Based on these goals, the workshop aims to formulate a research agenda for SE of sCPS."

    "abstract": "The relationships and interdependencies between software requirements and the architectures of software-intensive systems are described in the Twin Peaks model. The fundamental idea of the Twin Peaks model is that Requirements Engineering and Software Architecture should not be treated in isolation. Instead, we need to progressively discover and specify requirements while concurrently exploring alternative architectural solutions. However, bridging the gap between Requirements Engineering and Software Architecture has mainly been discussed independently in the respective communities. Therefore, this ICSE workshop aims at bringing together researchers, practitioners and educators from the Requirements Engineering and Software Architecture fields to jointly explore the strong interdependencies between requirements and architecture. Based on the results from previous editions of the workshop, this edition focuses on agile software development contexts and on exploring lightweight techniques for integrating requirements and architectural thinking."

This workshop is intended to foster a better understanding of software engineering errors and how a psychological perspective can reduce them, improving software quality and reducing maintenance costs. The workshop goal is to develop a body of knowledge that can advance our understanding of the psychological processes (of human reasoning, planning, and problem solving) and how they fail during the software development. Applying human error research to software quality improvement will provide insights to the cognitive aspects of software development. The workshop will include interactive session to discuss common themes of errors in different fields, and structure software error information to detect and prevent software errors during the development."
