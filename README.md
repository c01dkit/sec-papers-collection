**PRs and issues are warmly welcomed.**

## What about the previous one?

This website is version 2. I've rewritten the whole website and migrated it from Mkdocs to a Vue project.

The old version is archived in `archive_v1` branch.
You can switch to this branch and deploy the old one in your own website! 

## How to start a PR?

To update, first switch to `main` branch and simply update `data.yml` and run `main.py --json` to crawl and generate the latest information!
Then I will update my branch and deploy it.
Since the source code should be private according to Prime Block, the vue files are closed-source currently. ðŸ˜¢
